<small>IN THE STRAW-LOFT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Danny Moor</span> was feeling very happy as he
sat on the garden gate swinging his legs.</p>

<p>He had lived all his life in a very dull and
smoky part of London. Now, at last, his
mother had come to live in the country in a
village called Dutton, as lodge-keeper to Sir
Edward Finch. And Danny found himself
in a dear little house at the bottom of a long
drive.</p>

<p>It was an old-fashioned cottage with a
thatched roof, old black beams, and red tiled
floors. Honeysuckle grew in wild profusion
over the rustic porch and around the latticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
windows. Beyond its little garden stretched
the great park belonging to the Hall, where
spotted deer roamed free, and squirrels darted
like red flashes through the trees. The rarest
wild birds knew that here they were safe to
build their nests, unmolested. But that which
delighted Danny most was the great, grey ruin
of an ancient abbey. It stood in the park,
within a stone’s throw of his mother’s cottage.
As he lay in bed at night he could see the tall
grey tower looming up against the purple sky,
and the outline of the crumbling walls and
traceried windows clear against the stars. He
used to lie in bed and wonder, and make up
stories about the mysterious ruin.</p>

<p>Danny was not quite an ordinary boy. His
school-fellows used to laugh at him; the big
boys sometimes jeered at him; while his
own pals admired him and thought him very
clever. And everyone called him “Danny the
Detective.” This is why he came to be known
by that name.</p>

<p>Ever since he was quite a little chap Danny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
had loved anything mysterious. Detective
stories were his delight. He would creep
about in the dark old house in London,
playing at being a policeman tracking down a
burglar. When he grew a little older he would
play at “private detective,” scanning the
faces of the people in the streets as he went to
school, noticing their footprints and anything
strange about their appearance or behaviour.</p>

<p>He loved to sit by the fire, on winter evenings,
reading of Sherlock Holmes, and dreaming
that he was one of the people taking part
in those fascinating adventures. And his
mind was always full of splendid ideas for disguises
and secret messages. He taught himself
the Morse code, because he thought some
day it might be useful to know it. He might
find himself in a dungeon (who could tell?) and
want to communicate with someone on the
other side of the wall, and then he would tap
out the message with a knife. As he ran to
school in the morning he would repeat the
“iddy umpty” alphabet to himself, and spell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
out the names of the shops in dots and dashes,
so as to get in good practice.</p>

<p>But in the country everything was so different.
He did not know how you set about
being a detective in lanes and woods and fields.
It was Patrol-Leader Dick Church who solved
the problem, and also gave him the most
ripping idea he had ever had in his life.</p>

<p>Dick was the stable-boy up at the Hall. He
was also senior Patrol-Leader of the 1st Dutton
Troop of Boy Scouts. He had soon made
friends with the lonely little boy from London,
and Danny was now as keen an admirer of
Dick Church as every other small boy in the
village.</p>

<p>It was on the day that they sat in the straw-loft
up at the Hall, eating gooseberries, that
Danny learnt about Wolf Cubs. He had often
longed to be a Scout; it seemed the next best
thing to being a real detective. But he was only
ten, so there was no hope. Now, as they sat together
in the dusty, golden straw, among the
cobwebs and the old black beams, Danny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
learnt that it was possible to be a Junior Scout
or Wolf Cub, even though you were “only a
kid!”</p>

<p>His heart beat fast.</p>

<p>“Do they learn tracking?” he said.</p>

<p>“Rather,” said Dick, “and signalling and
swimming and first aid and all sorts of things—just
like us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll join ’em,” said Danny, wriggling
about in the straw in his excitement.</p>

<p>Dick laughed and aimed a gooseberry at a
big rat who happened to be passing.</p>

<p>“Look here, youngster,” he said, “don’t
you get the idea that Scouting is all play,
all ragging about, and dressing up, and paper-chasing—’cos
it’s not.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” said Danny.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the Patrol-Leader, lying
back till his head was half-smothered in his
stalky pillow.</p>

<p>“It means doing good turns to other people
every chance you get. And it puts the lid on
telling lies or sneaking or pinching things or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
swearing. It means making a solemn promise
and doing anything rather than break it. It
means jolly well bucking up all round. And
it means <i>sticking to it</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Danny, and he pondered in
silence for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Dick looked at his small friend.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, kid,” he said. “You’ll make
a top-hole Cub if you try. The Cub motto
is, ‘<i>Do Your Best</i>.’ D’you think you can live
up to that?”</p>

<p>“Not <i>half</i>!” said Danny, and from that
time he decided to be a Cub—a <i>real</i> Cub,
inside as well as out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Cubs’ bare knees were splashed with mud
as they pounded along the lane, looking out
keenly for the little scraps of white paper that
formed the “scent” of the hares.</p>

<p>“Phew!” panted one of the hounds, “I’m
hot.”</p>

<p>“Stick—to—it!” panted back his pal.</p>

<p>“Are we downhearted?” called Jim Tate,
the Sixer, as he had heard Tommies call out
at the end of a long route march.</p>

<p>“No—o—o!” came the answer right down
the road, for some Cubs were getting left
behind.</p>

<p>But Danny, having lived all his life in London,
had not done much in the way of long runs.
He had got a bad stitch in his side almost at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
once, but remembering the second Cub Law—“A
Cub does not give in to himself”—he had
set his teeth, and determined to bear the pain,
and not to give in. Then his legs began to ache
as if they were ready to break. But he stuck
out manfully. Finally his wind gave out.</p>

<p>“I’m done,” he gasped.</p>

<p>“No, you aren’t,” called his Sixer. “Here—hang
on!” and he held out a hand to his recruit.
“We shall get them, I bet. We’ve kept it
up hot so far.”</p>

<p>Just then the white paper showed up a bank,
and over the fence, into a field. With a howl
the Cubs scrambled up the grassy bank, clinging
to weeds and sticks and stones, and were
soon in full cry across the grass. On they went,
and through a hedge on to the road beyond.
But there was no “scent” on the road; no
paper showed on the brown mud.</p>

<p>“False trail!” groaned the hounds.</p>

<p>“Bad luck,” called Jim, the Sixer, “we must
go back. We may get them yet.” And the
hounds dashed off again across the field to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
back to the old “scent.” But it was too
much for Danny. He sank down, tired out.</p>

<p>“They <i>can</i> run!” he said. And he thought,
a little sadly, that they would think him
a rotter to have fallen out. “I stuck it as
long as I could,” he said. “I did my best—I
couldn’t do more.”</p>

<p>He was just going to start back to Headquarters
when something happened which was
the first step in the curious adventures that
befell him from that day onwards.</p>

<p>“Swish-sh-sh!” sounded the tires of a
bicycle on the muddy road, as it flew past him
like a streak. The rider was bareheaded and
seemed in an awful hurry. Then something
happened that made Danny jump up and start
running down the road for all he was worth,
quite forgetful of his weary legs. A dog had
jumped out from the hedge, and, in trying to
avoid running over it, the cyclist had skidded
badly, and now lay quite still on the road.</p>

<p>Danny panted down the muddy lane,
hoping the man was not dead, but, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
he reached the place where the accident had
happened, the stranger had got up and was
sitting on the bank, his head in his hands.</p>

<p>“Can I help you, sir?” said Danny eager to
do a good turn.</p>

<p>The young man started and looked up at the
boy with wild eyes; then peered about him and
looked up and down the road, as if he were
afraid of being followed. Blood was streaming
down his face from a nasty gash in his
forehead.</p>

<p>“Can I help you, sir?” repeated Danny.
“Let me tie up your head—it’s bleeding
badly.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the young man in a
shaky voice.</p>

<p>Danny was glad to find he had put a large,
clean handkerchief in his pocket before starting.
He knew enough about first aid to realise
the danger of putting on an open wound
anything that is at all dirty. So he opened out
the handkerchief and laid the part that had
been folded up inside, on the wound. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
could he use as a bandage? There was nothing
handy.</p>

<p>So, with a sigh of regret, he realised he must
sacrifice his beautiful new brown neckerchief.
He took it off and folded it neatly into a “narrow
bandage.” This he tied firmly around
the young man’s head, securing it with a reef
knot.</p>

<p>“You’re a bit shaky, sir, aren’t you?”
he said. “My home is in the next village.
Won’t you come back and rest? Mother will
give you some tea, and I’ll run for a doctor.
I think your head will want stitching.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said the young man
quickly, looking down the road again. “I
assure you I am quite all right now. I was
just a little stunned. I thank you for your
assistance, my little friend.”</p>

<p>There was something curious about the
way the man spoke. Danny wondered what
it was. “Foreigner,” he said to himself, as he
picked up the bicycle and held it for the
stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Could you tell me the way to Thornhurst?”
asked the man.</p>

<p>Danny thought a moment, and told him
as well as he could.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the stranger. He was
about to mount his bicycle when a thought
seemed to strike him. Turning to the Cub,
“Little boy,” he said, “should any person
ask you if you have seen me on this road,
tell them you have seen <i>no one</i>—no one at
all.”</p>

<p>Danny grinned.</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir,” he said. “Can’t tell a lie.”</p>

<p>The man swore under his breath. “Little
fool,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Then he held out a bright half-crown.
“That will keep you quiet,” he said.</p>

<p>Danny flushed, and then laughed scornfully.
“Not much—it won’t,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the man angrily, “tell them
I’ve gone to Thornhurst, and am taking a
train to London. I shall be in Dover to-morrow.
You won’t forget—London and Dover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Danny nodded, and the man jumped on his
bicycle and rode away.</p>

<p>“He’s a queer chap,” said Danny, “and I
bet there’s something on somewhere. Wish
I knew what it was.” The detective spirit was
roused in him. Suddenly he forgot all about
Cubs and paper-chases. He was a private
detective again, as in the old London days.
Kneeling on the ground, he examined the
man’s footprints in the mud, and made a
sketch of them and of the bicycle tracks in
his notebook. Then, feeling very important,
he wrote a short report of the adventure in his
pocket-book, added the date (July 1, 1914),
and started off across the fields to get back
to the Pack Headquarters.</p>

<p>About half a mile on, his path lay across
the yard of an old deserted mill. As he
clambered over the wall, something made
him glance at the mill pool a hundred yards
away. By it, in the shadow of the mill,
stood the mysterious stranger, who had bicycled
away half an hour ago towards Thornhurst!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
His head was still bound up with
Danny’s scarf.</p>

<p>Remembering the law of the jungle, Danny
“froze.” Squatting perfectly still on the top
of the wall he watched, breathlessly. What
could the stranger be doing there? Thornhurst
was in the opposite direction. He had
said he was going there, and on to London.</p>

<p>Looking about him warily the stranger
picked up his bicycle and flung it into the dark
waters of the pool. Danny heard the splash,
and all was still.</p>

<p>Then the man looked about him again, turning
his head from side to side, as if to make
sure he was not perceived. What was he going
to do? Then, alas, he saw Danny! For one
moment he stood quite still, gazing up at
him, as if in dismay. Then, like a shadow,
he vanished behind the crumbling walls of
the deserted mill.</p>

<p>For a moment, Danny stood quite still,
his eyes and mouth wide open with utter

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Then the detective instinct in him realised
that there must be something very “fishy”
about a person who threw a good bike into
a pond! He also realised that if he was to find
out anything about this fishy person there was
not a moment to be lost, so he scrambled down
off the rickety old wall that he had been scaling,
when he got his glimpse of the man, and
set off across the yard.</p>

<p>The man had caught sight of Danny, he felt
sure, just after flinging the bicycle into the
pond. This was why he had vanished so
quickly. The pond was hidden from Danny’s
view when he got down from the wall. Would
this give the stranger a chance to escape?</p>

<p>A moment later Danny was hurrying down
the steep bank towards the marshy ground
where the pond lay.</p>

<p>When he reached the pool there was no
sign of the man. He peered about in the old
barns, the rickety sheds, and the broken pig-sty—the
man was nowhere. He went up into
the mill. He climbed up ladders to the topmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
floor. He peered between the great
millstones. He leant far out of the windows
and looked up and down the road and across
the fields. There was no sign of the stranger.</p>

<p>“He must be a jolly good scout to have hidden
so quickly,” said Danny to himself. “I
wasn’t more than two minutes getting to the
pond, but he managed to bunk.”</p>

<p>The only thing to do was to track the man
down. Yes, there were the footmarks and
a bicycle track in the soft mud of the little
path that led down from the road to the
marshy ground by the pond. Danny examined
them carefully; they were quite fresh.
He compared them with the drawing he had
made in his pocket-book half an hour before,
and they tallied exactly. So this <i>was</i> the
same man; there could be no mistake.</p>

<p>With his heart thumping hard, Danny followed
up the tracks. They led to the pond in
a roundabout way, showing that the man had
taken cover behind a hedge, the old barn, and
a broken wall. By the side of the pond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
wheel tracks stopped. Danny could see the
firm, deep marks where the man had stood
while picking up the machine and throwing it
into the water.</p>

<p>Then the footmarks went off at right angles;
four long strides—and they stopped behind the
broken wall, where the man seemed to have
stood still. Danny searched all round, but
the footmarks did not go any further. And
yet there was no cover here!</p>

<p>He walked in a circle round the spot at about
five yards’ distance, but no tracks were to be
seen. Danny the Detective was sorely puzzled.
But, returning to the place by the wall
where the man had stood, he suddenly saw
what he had missed before. The footprints
did leave the spot, but they went straight back
to the pond-side, treading almost where the
first footprints showed!</p>

<p>He followed them up. But at the water’s
edge he was as puzzled as he had been at the
wall. The footprints did not lead away!</p>

<p>Danny was stumped. There was nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
more to be done. It seemed a mystery with
no solution—a riddle with no answer. He
determined to put the matter into the hands
of wiser people than he.</p>

<p>Squatting on the old wall he wrote in his
notebook an account of what had passed.
Then he set off homewards. At the Pack
Headquarters, he found Fred Codding, his
Sixer, ramping on the step.</p>

<p>“You little rotter!” he cried, as soon as he
saw Danny. “What did you want to fall out
for, and then play about and not come back?
All the other chaps have gone back to tea.
But when we found that you were not at
your house I was told to wait here and report
to Mr. Fox if you were not back by 6.30.”</p>

<p>“Awfully sorry, Fred,” said Danny, “but
I wasn’t playing about. I was having a wonderful
adventure. I——”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” said Fred, impatiently.
“We know all about your ‘adventures.’”</p>

<p>“But this is <i>truth</i>,” said Danny, in despair.
“A most extraordinary thing happened——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Dry up!” said Fred.</p>

<p>But Danny was determined to make him
listen.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, “it’s all very well
for you to say, ‘Dry up,’ but what would you
say if you saw a chap chuck a good bike into
a pond and then make off?”</p>

<p>“I’d say the chap who told me such a yarn
was a liar,” said Fred. “I must go and report
that you’ve got back,” he added. “You cut
along home and stop telling everyone detective
stories. Remember you’re a Wolf Cub, and
not a kid any more. A Cub is truthful.”</p>

<p>Danny flushed to the roots of his hair. But
he had the sense not to answer back, for he
knew that if he did he would not be able to
resist punching his Sixer’s head—and that
would not be loyalty. So he turned and went
sadly home.</p>

<p>But the strange thing he had seen was not to
be put out of his mind so easily. Something
must be done. He decided to go to the Scouts
about it that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>After tea he set out for the Scouts’ Headquarters.
There was a meeting on. He banged
at the door.</p>

<p>“What d’you want?” said the Second who
opened it.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to Patrol-Leader Church,”
said Danny. He felt sure his friend would
give him a fair hearing.</p>

<p>“He’s away,” said the Scout, “gone to see
his uncle at Thornhurst.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got something very important to
report,” said Danny.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said the Scout kindly, “there’s
a Court of Honour sitting just now. Come
another time.”</p>

<p>But here the Chairman’s voice broke in.</p>

<p>“Bring the kid in,” he called. “Let’s hear
the ‘important’ matter!”</p>

<p>Danny entered the brightly lighted room
shyly. The eight Leaders and Seconds stared
at him. Then one of them, Fred Codding’s
big brother, burst into a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he cried, “it’s ‘Danny the Detective!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
I hear from my young brother that
he’s got a wonderful yarn about a mysterious
stranger and a bike and a pond!”</p>

<p>Danny flushed. Then he looked straight
at Patrol-Leader Codding.</p>

<p>“Your brother wouldn’t believe me,” he
said, “but I’m a Wolf Cub, and I wouldn’t
tell a lie for anything. It’s the truth, and
that’s what I’ve come about.”</p>

<p>The Patrol-Leaders smiled.</p>

<p>“All right, youngster,” said the Chairman,
“sit down. And when we’ve done the job
we’re on now, you can make your report.”</p>

<p>Danny sat down, wishing himself a hundred
miles away. Presently the Chairman called
him up.</p>

<p>“Please give the Court your report about
this stranger,” he said solemnly.</p>

<p>Danny forgot his shyness. It seemed to
him that he was a chief witness, giving evidence
at a court of law. Very clearly he told his
story.</p>

<p>The Court deliberated for a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“It’s a good yarn, anyway!” said the Chairman,
“though I can’t see the chap’s idea in
throwing his bike in the pond. Look here,
youngster, we’ll take the matter in hand.
Kangaroo Patrol shall go with you to-morrow
and drag the pond. If they find the bike we
will take further steps.”</p>

<p>This was duly recorded in the minutes by
the Secretary.</p>

<p>Danny was delighted.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much indeed!” he said,
and, saluting, withdrew.</p>

<p>“Smart little chap!” said the Leaders, as
they turned once more to the business on
hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE MILL POND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Saturday. At 2.30 the Kangaroos
were coming to drag the pond. Danny had
got up at 6.30 and was at the scene of yesterday’s
adventures by 7.30. The tracks were
still clear, but there were no new ones.</p>

<p>All the morning he was on guard, now
watching from his place of ambush behind
the old wall; now exploring the mill for any
possible clues.</p>

<p>The sky was black with threatening clouds.
At twelve the storm broke. The rain came
down in torrents. Danny took shelter in the
mill, keeping watch on the pond from the window.
It was nearly two before the downpour
ceased. Then a pale sunbeam broke out,
and Danny ventured forth into the dripping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
world. Little streamlets gurgled down the
paths; cataracts gushed from pipes and gutters
about the mill. Small ponds lay in hollow
places.</p>

<p>And, alas, the tracks of the stranger’s steps
were hidden by an ocean of muddy water!</p>

<p>Danny’s heart sank. He had counted so on
showing the Kangaroos this incontestable evidence.
Any Scout would have read the true
story of yesterday’s adventures in those marks.
And now they were gone!</p>

<p>At 2.30 the Kangaroos arrived, very keen
on the job. They dragged the pond from end
to end. They raked its bottom with a hay-rake.
They probed it with a pitchfork. Then
they laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” said the Patrol-Leader.
“’Fraid you must have been dreaming yesterday,
young Wolf Cub.”</p>

<p>Danny was astounded. He had seen the
bicycle thrown in, and now he had seen the
pond dragged with great thoroughness and no
bicycle revealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>The youngest Kangaroo had a bright idea.</p>

<p>“I expect the chap came early this morning
and dragged the pond himself and got up the
bike,” he said.</p>

<p>Danny shook his head.</p>

<p>“I was here before it began to rain,” he said,
“and there were no fresh tracks.”</p>

<p>The Kangaroos went away, very bored and
very muddy. It was not long before the story
had spread through the whole Troop and the
whole Pack. Everyone was inclined to agree
with Fred Codding, the Sixer, that Danny the
Detective was a little liar. But Danny, though
hopelessly bewildered, <i>knew</i> that what he had
seen the day before had not been a dream.</p>

<p>The next few days were very unhappy.
Danny was in hopeless disgrace. The Scouts
laughed. The Cubs were angry because he
had brought disgrace on the Pack. The
Scoutmaster chaffed Mr. Fox, the Cubmaster,
and said he had heard there was a budding
novelist in the Pack!</p>

<p>The only comforting thing that happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
was that in a local paper there appeared a
short account of a gentleman’s bicycle having
mysteriously disappeared from outside a shop
where he had left it.</p>

<p>But instead of this convincing everyone that
Danny’s story was true, he was only chaffed
about the little paragraph.</p>

<p>All this made him quite determined to clear
his honour and the honour of the Pack. He
made up his mind never to rest until he had
solved the mystery. From then onward he
looked at everyone with the eye of a detective.
Not one stranger escaped his notice,
or one unusual track upon the road. He was
untiringly on the alert.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the weather had cleared up.
The hot July sun had dried the mud completely.
The roads became so hard that there
was no chance of tracking. Danny was sorry
for this, for he was ever on the lookout for
the footmarks of which he had a sketch in his
book. Now there seemed no chance by this
means of obtaining a clue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>But before a month had gone by he had
met with another stranger who seemed to form
another link in the mysterious chain.</p>

<p>To their pride and joy the 1st Dutton Wolf
Cubs had been invited by the Scouts to take
part in a great field day. Danny had been
given a quarter of a mile of road to patrol. It
happened to be the lonely lane that led past
the deserted mill.</p>

<p>He had just concealed himself in the
hedge when a market-cart rumbled by. A
little ahead of him it stopped. The carter
looked keenly up and down the road and
all about him. Then, as if sure he was
not perceived, he pushed aside his vegetable
baskets, lifted up a piece of sacking, and
helped a man to emerge from the bottom
of the cart. Without a single word the man
jumped down on to the road, and the cart
lumbered on.</p>

<p>The stranger stood for a moment looking
about him suspiciously. He was a very
ragged and dirty tramp, with a straggling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
red beard and a great, bulgy sack on his
shoulders. Presently, as if to make sure
of his whereabouts, he began to plod along
the road.</p>

<p>Danny was after him like a flash, his rubber
shoes making no noise on the road. It was
<i>real</i> “stalking” this time! Scanning every
detail of the man’s appearance, Danny could
find nothing to show that he was not a genuine
tramp. But that which caught his eye was
the sack. It was bulgy and ragged. Out of
a hole hung a rabbit skin. But there was
evidently something large and square in the
sack as well. It looked as if it might be a box.
And from inside this seemed to come a scraping,
scuffling noise, as if it contained something
alive.</p>

<p>At this moment the tramp turned suddenly
around and saw him.</p>

<p>Danny was a boy who always had all
his wits about him. He was a London boy,
remember! He realised at once that he must
put the man off his guard and not let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
him think that he had followed him out of
suspicion.</p>

<p>“Please, mister,” he said, “could you tell
me the time?”</p>

<p>The man was staring angrily at him out
of a pair of little, pale blue eyes. He had
evidently been startled at finding a Wolf
Cub at his heels when he had thought himself
quite alone! The innocent question must
have reassured him, for he looked very much
relieved.</p>

<p>“It’s three o’clock,” he said gruffly.</p>

<p>Danny was looking him over eagerly. What
<i>could</i> he say next, so as not to have to go
away? Surely this strange man who crept out
from among baskets in a cart, carried something
alive in a bag full of rabbit skins, and
knew the exact time without a watch, must be
a “suspicious character!”</p>

<p>“I say, mister,” he continued, skipping
along innocently by the man, “are you collecting
rabbit skins and bottles?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Are you going to Dutton?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know the pub. called ‘The Green
Man’——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it well.”</p>

<p>(<i>Ah</i>, thought Danny, <i>I’ve caught you, old
sport</i>! <i>There’s not a pub. called “The Green
Man” at Dutton!</i>)</p>

<p>“Well,” he went on aloud, “just a bit further
on, past the pub., there’s a little thatched
house. That’s where my mother lives. She’ll
give you some skins, ’cos we had rabbit-pie
last night for supper. You will go to her,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll go there right enough,” said the
man.</p>

<p>(<i>We’ll see</i>! thought Danny.)</p>

<p>But the man was walking fast. He had
very nearly reached the part of the road where
Danny’s patrol ended. It seemed to the Cub
that the most important thing in all the world
just now was to follow up this man. But he
knew that he must not fail in his duty. Senior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Patrol-Leader Church had posted him on that
road and said:</p>

<p>“Don’t leave your post without orders.”
So he must stick to it.</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, mister,” he said. “I’ve
got to stay here ’cos I’m a sentry. Don’t
forget to call for mother’s rabbit skins.”</p>

<p>“All right,” growled the man, and trudged
on while Danny squatted down on the bank
and watched him.</p>

<p>“I bet he’s not going to the village!” he
said to himself. “He’s a stranger here, but he
wants to make out he’s not. And I’m pretty
sure he’s not a real tramp, ’cos he has hands
like a gentleman. Oh, I <i>do</i> wish I could follow
him! I wish it was a muddy day instead of
this rotten dry weather—then I’d soon pick
up his trail when this game’s over. I wonder
if there’s not some way I could track him.”</p>

<p>He racked his brains for a moment and
tried to remember what private detectives on
the pictures do on such occasions. Suddenly,
like a flash, he remembered a fairy story he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
had read in <i>Hans Andersen</i>. It was about a
mother who wanted to know where her daughter
went off to in the night, so she sewed a
little bag full of flour on to the girl’s dress and
cut a hole in the corner of it, so that, as she
went along, the flour ran out, and the mother
was able to track the girl all through the
streets.</p>

<p>“Wish I had a little bag full of flour,”
thought Danny. But a Wolf Cub is never at
a loss how to do things, once he has got hold
of the idea. In a minute he had drawn his
notebook out of his pocket and torn a number
of pages out. With quick fingers he tore these
up into wee scraps and put them into his
cap.</p>

<p>The man was already out of sight round the
corner. Scrambling up the bank and through
the hedge into a field, Danny sprinted along
for all he was worth.</p>

<p>Before long he was up with the man, who
still plodded along, head bent, his sack on
his back. Creeping like a little green snake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
through the hedge, Danny stole softly up behind
him.</p>

<p>He felt just as Cubs do in the <i>Sheer Khan
Dance</i>, only this time it was <i>real</i>, not “pretend.”
Holding his breath and treading as
softly as a cat, he crept so close that he could
have touched the tramp. Still the man
trudged on. Danny’s heart was in his
mouth.</p>

<p>Softly he straightened himself. Then he
took a handful of the paper-scraps from his
cap and slipped them into the torn pocket of
the man’s ragged coat. Then he stood quite
still and gradually crept sideways until he was
under cover in the ditch. His heart was beating
fast. As he watched the retreating figure
of the man he saw a little scrap of paper fly
out here and there.</p>

<p>“I’ve got you!” said Danny, hugging himself.
It was all he could do not to give vent
to a howl of joy that would have roused the
very jungle!</p>

<p>It was at this moment that an “enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Scout” trod on a dry stick the other side of
the hedge and set Danny on his guard. Lying
flat on his tummy in the ditch and peeping
through a patch of nettles, he caught sight of
a flutter of red and grey that was unmistakably
a Kangaroo shoulder-knot!</p>

<p>Creeping along the ditch, regardless of the
hundred nettle-stings that raised great white
lumps on his knees, Danny indulged in a little
strategy. Taking off his cap, he arranged it
on a stump so that it just showed above a
mass of green and would be well in view from
a gap in the hedge.</p>

<p>Then he doubled along the ditch to where a
hidden gap gave a beautiful chance for the
enemy to cross the road, and, getting over a
stile into the wood opposite, to get in touch
with their own party. By this tempting gap
Danny took cover.</p>

<p>“I hope he sees my cap,” he said to himself,
“then he’ll think I’m there, and will
bring his party up to this fence.” Suddenly a
bright idea struck him. “I’ll <i>make</i> him have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
a look at it,” he said. Standing cautiously
up in the ditch, he picked up a stone and
took careful aim. <i>Plump</i>—it fell among the
nettles, just by the cap. “That’ll make him
think there’s a chap there,” said the detective
to himself with satisfaction. And sure enough,
before long, the Kangaroos, thinking the sentry
was safely ensconced in the ditch further up,
were making their way with an unguarded
amount of crackling towards the gap. Two
minutes later Danny had taken three important
prisoners and sent them to the base “out
of action.”</p>

<p>“Jolly smart piece of work,” said Patrol-Leader
Church, when the field was called in at
five o’clock. “I knew I had put a good man
on to patrol that road, but I never thought
he’d succeed in taking prisoners!”</p>

<p>Danny’s heart glowed at the praise, but his
mind was more intent upon the piece of <i>real</i>
scouting he had on hand than on the game.
When the other boys trooped home to tea,
happy and hungry, Danny turned his eager<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
steps in the direction of the lonely piece of
road he had been patrolling. He forgot how
hungry he was and how nice the cup of tea
and the plum cake at home would be. There
was work to be done.</p>

<p>In about half an hour Danny was back at
the place where he had last seen the tramp.
It was a still, summer evening. Not a breath
of wind stirred. Danny was glad, for it
meant that the scent, in the form of the scraps
of paper, would not have blown away. Yes!
There was a little piece on the road. Here was
another on the bank. Another—another—another!
Now there was none for quite a
long way. Then—a whole patch on the dusty
road! Just here the tramp had been walking
at the side of the road, where the dust was
soft and white and thick. Joy of joys—his
footmarks were distinctly visible!</p>

<p>Out came Danny’s precious notebook, and
in a moment he had drawn a quick sketch of
the footprint and added its size in inches.
Then he went on carefully. Every here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
there a little piece of white paper showed distinctly.
He had reached the old mill. And
sure enough the trail turned down the very
path where he had followed the bicycle tracks
six weeks ago! In the same way it seemed to
indicate that the man had taken cover behind
walls and hedges, so as not to be seen from the
road or from the mill. Little did he know that
he left a tell-tale track of white paper behind
him! And as Danny reached the pond
he had to put his hands over his mouth to
suppress a laugh of delight. There, on the
surface of the still, black water, showed a
quantity of little scraps of white paper!</p>

<p>Danny walked round the bank, thinking
hard. What on earth could the man have
got into the pond for?</p>

<p>There were no wet marks on the dust where
he got out. It was the most mysterious thing
he had ever come across. Here was a pond
in which a man and a bicycle had disappeared,
and also a tramp with something alive in a
sack! Had they drowned themselves? No—for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> 
the Kangaroos had dragged the pond and
nothing had been fished up.</p>

<p>Suddenly Danny had an idea.</p>

<p>“There must be a kind of cave or cellar
they get into from under the water!” he said.
“I expect they are burglars or smugglers or
forgers or something. And that’s where they
hide their treasure. Then, after dark, they
come up.” He decided to have another try
to make the Scouts take him seriously; but he
was still sore at the memory of all the ridicule
that had been heaped upon him before.</p>

<p>“I’ll log it down,” he said, taking out his
notebook, “and after dark I’ll come back and
lie in wait for him as he comes up. Then to-morrow
I’ll make my report.”</p>

<p>He squatted down behind the ruined wall
and began to write:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“July 26, 1914.</p>

<p>“Saw a tramp get out of a cart, where he

were rabbit skins and bottles. Said he knew
a pub. called ‘Green Man’ in Dutton, which
there isn’t. Tracked him down by scraps of
paper. He must have got into Mill Pond,
but he has not got out yet (6.30).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Night</span> had fallen, soft and dark and still,
when Danny climbed out of his little latticed
window on to the roof of the porch. He could
smell the honeysuckle though he could not see
it. And somewhere a nightingale was singing.
He had gone up to bed at 9 o’clock. His
mother had come in and tucked him up, and,
shutting the door, had gone downstairs.</p>

<p>Now Danny scrambled down the trellis-work
of the porch and was soon trotting softly
along the road. As he got beyond the village
his courage began to fail just a wee bit. The
road was very dark and lonely. Great black
fir trees stretched out weird arms towards
him. An owl hooted. A rabbit scampered
across his path with a whisk of white tail.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Once he jumped as a cow poked her head
through a gap at him, and heaved a great sigh.
Between the weird black branches of the pines
he could see the little, white, sparkling stars
winking at him. They reminded him of God,
and that after all he was not quite alone. God
must be pleased with him, because he was
“<i>doing his best</i>.” The lonely darkness ceased
to be full of horror. He went on with a brave
heart.</p>

<p>At last he reached the pond. All was
quite still. After listening intently for a few
minutes, he flashed his electric torch on the
water. The scraps of paper were still floating
about. He walked round the bank, casting
a ring of golden light on to the dusty ground.
But there were no wet footmarks to show that
someone had come up out of the water.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep watch,” said Danny, and he
curled up in the shadow of the wall.</p>

<p>It was a warm July night, but Danny’s
teeth were chattering as he squatted alone
beneath the ruined wall. He gazed fascinated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
at the black waters of the pond. Any moment
a face, with a red, straggly beard, might come
up, all wet and dripping and look at him. He
half-wished he had not come. But he had
vowed to do all he could to solve the problem,
and surely he was on the scent at last.</p>

<p>The moments crept by and nothing happened.
Everything was very still, save for
the occasional hoot of an owl. The world
seemed fast asleep. Presently Danny began
to nod.</p>

<p>It must have been three hours later when
he awoke, stiff and uncomfortable. Where
was he? Oh yes! He jumped up quickly,
rubbing his eyes. He had slept on guard.
He blushed in the darkness. Just think—if
he had been a soldier and his officer had come
round—the shame of it! And suddenly he
found he was simply longing for home and
mother and bed.</p>

<p>“My duty,” he said between his chattering
teeth. Switching on his electric torch, he
went softly round the pond. But there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
no wet marks on the parched, dusty bank;
so no one had come up out of the water.</p>

<p>From away across the valley stole the faint
sound of a church clock. The four quarters
rang out; Danny listened for the hour. <i>One</i>
... chimed like a sad voice across the
dim countryside. “One o’clock,” whispered
Danny. He could not resist the longing for
home, and softly he made his way back on to
the road.</p>

<p>“Rh-rrru-um!” A great, grey car swung
round the corner and hummed past Danny.</p>

<p>“A.R. 1692,” he said to himself as he
watched the red tail-light grow smaller and
smaller in the distance. Almost from force
of habit he fixed the number in his mind.</p>

<p>Danny’s feet seemed to have acquired a
nasty habit of tumbling over each other. He
wondered why. And then he gave a big
yawn. How lovely it would be to be in bed—all
warm and safe and cosy, and, best of all,
to hear mother snoring in the next room! It
was so lonely out here. He trudged sleepily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
on and round the corner towards Dutton.
He was walking on the grass at the side of the
road. A ditch ran along the hedge.</p>

<p>Suddenly, almost at his feet, he heard a
long, muffled whistle. He started violently,
and then, remembering the law of the wild,
he “froze.” The next moment three whistle
notes sounded, not quite so muffled, and
coming, certainly, from the ditch. Then a
strange, guttural voice, speaking in low tones.
It was there, at his feet, in the ditch. What
could it mean? Danny, the sleepy little boy,
was trembling with fear, but Danny the
Detective was on the scent again.</p>

<p>Creeping softly across the grass to the edge
of the ditch he dropped on one knee and
peered down. It was far too dark to see
anything. So he strained his ears to try and
catch this mysterious conversation. He soon
found that, though he could hear every word
distinctly, he could not understand it. It was
in a foreign language! There seemed a lot
of “ach,” and “gr-r-r” in it; very ugly it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
sounded. And the word “so” seemed to
come in it rather often. “Nine” was mentioned
still more often. Danny listened
intently for any words he could recognise.
Presently he heard “Sir Edward Grey” ...
quite distinctly. It did not convey much to
him, but at least the words were English, and
he stored them up. “Downing Street” ...
he caught, and, later on, “Asquith.”...</p>

<p>It was a funny conversation. It kept
breaking off suddenly, and there would be a
long silence. Then it would go on for a few
words and stop. And, somehow, the whole
thing reminded him of how it sounded when
the postmaster <i>telephoned</i> from the village
post-office.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a movement in the
ditch. “They’re coming out,” thought Danny.
Like a rabbit he scuttled out of sight into a
place where the bank in front of the ditch
formed a kind of little, earthy grotto, half
overgrown with bushes. He was hidden in the
darkness, but he could see well himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>As he peered out, straining his eyes in the
gloom, he saw a black figure rear itself out of
the ditch and stand up against the grey star-spangled
sky. He could see its outline quite
clearly. It was that of a slight, smallish man.
In his hand he held something that looked like
about three yards of rather thick rope. For a
moment he stood still, brushing the mud from
his suit. It was at this moment, when silence
was so essential, that Danny felt a violent
tickle in his nose.</p>

<p>He was going to sneeze!</p>

<p>“A—hi——A—hi—— A—<i>tis</i>hu!” He tried
to muffle it in his cap, but it was no use. The
man started violently, then looked about him
quickly. One step brought him close to
Danny’s grotto. He had dropped his rope
end, and against the grey sky Danny could
see the outline of a revolver in his right
hand.</p>

<p>Slowly the man bent towards him, peering
through the darkness. Seeing nothing, he
stretched out his hand to feel. Cold sweat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
broke out all over Danny. In a second the
man would have touched him.</p>

<p>To keep still meant being caught for certain.
To dash out and run would probably mean a
bullet in his legs. The groping hand was very
near his face. Suddenly an idea seized Danny.
The man would not risk the danger of breaking
the night stillness with a shot if he thought
that the sound he had heard had merely been
made by a <i>fox</i>; nor would he bother to follow
it up or be in any way disturbed or set on his
guard by its presence. With a sudden movement
he fastened his sharp little teeth in the
hand. The man gave a muffled cry of pain,
started back, and Danny, with the bark of a
young fox, dashed out past his legs in a doubled-up
position, and was soon running down the
road under cover of the darkness. Leaping
across the ditch and through a well-known gap,
he threw himself down on the grass, panting.
There was no sound of following footsteps.
His ruse had succeeded.</p>

<p>Cautiously Danny rose to his feet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
began walking down the side of the hedge
on the field side. He was making for home.
Strangers with revolvers were not to be followed
in the dark, even by detectives, when
the latter were unarmed. But before long he
had stopped short and was peering through
the hedge. A little red light had caught his
eye. Yes, it was the tail-light of a motor—A.R.
1692! It was the same car that had
passed him—he remembered the number!
The head-lights had been turned off. The
great body of the car loomed like some huge
monster in the darkness. Danny could just
make out the form of a man sitting quite still
in the driver’s seat. He seemed to be waiting
for something.</p>

<p>Perhaps the man who had been talking in
the ditch was going to rejoin him. Danny,
managing to overcome his fear of the revolver,
decided to wait and watch. Before long there
was a slight sound and the man he had seen
before stepped on to the road from the grassy
border that had muffled his approaching steps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
The men exchanged a few words in the same
guttural language Danny had heard coming
from the ditch. Then the driver got down
from the car and lit up the head-lights. A
bright shaft shot along the road.</p>

<p>Bending down, the man allowed his face
to be caught in it for a moment, and Danny
looked with all his eyes, so that he might
remember every feature.</p>

<p>He was a thick-set man with a square,
black beard and thick-lensed, round glasses.
An exclamation of annoyance from him
brought his friend round to help adjust one
of the lamps, and Danny had a glimpse of the
second man’s face. He knew him in a moment!
It was the mysterious stranger of the bicycle
incident, on whose track he had been for so
long!</p>

<p>The head-lights being successfully fixed up,
the driver of the car went round to the back,
and Danny watched, fascinated, while he
removed the number board and substituted
for it one showing “L. 323.” Then together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the men raised the hood of the car, though it
was a cloudless night. After moving about
some time they both got into the car. But
the automatic starter would not work, and
the driver, grumbling to himself, climbed out
again and went round to turn the handle.</p>

<p>This brought his face once more within the
light of the great lamps. Danny’s eyes
opened wide at what he saw. The motorist
was no longer a black-bearded, spectacled,
man. He had now a bristling red moustache
and his bright little blue eyes showed out from
beneath rather bushy eyebrows! A moment
later the car had hummed off down the road.</p>

<small>THE DARK PASSAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was nine o’clock when Danny woke up the
next day—a golden Sunday morning. At
first he thought his night adventures had been
a dream, and then he realised that it was all
true, and jumped out of bed. He longed to
tell someone about them. But, remembering
the snubs he had received before, and that he
had been accused of having lied, he determined
to keep his wonderful discoveries to
himself. This adventure should be all his own.
Danny the Detective would have a big triumph
when the whole mysterious case was
brought to light, and the wily strangers stood
in the dock! His first impulse was to make
straight for the scene of last night’s adventure.
Then, remembering that private detectives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
as well as other people must fulfil their duty
to God, he set off for church. And after
all, he had much to thank God for! Last
night he had had a very narrow escape. And
also he had got the desire of his heart—a new
and important clue.</p>

<p>Church over, he dashed off to examine the
ditch. Yes, there was his grotto—he could
see it from afar. On reaching the place, the
first thing that caught his eye was a long,
snake-like something lying half hidden in the
rank grass. He picked it up. It was a piece
of rubber tubing about three yards long.</p>

<p>“That must be what the man dropped when
I sneezed,” said Danny. “I expect he was so
worried with my biting his hand that he forgot
to pick it up!”</p>

<p>The detective next turned his attention to
the ditch. Yes, there were footmarks in the
soft mud. And they were the very same that
he had drawn a sketch of in his book that day
he saw the stranger with the bicycle! There
was a kind of dented, flattened place, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
someone had been lying in the ditch. Sticking
out of the bank, half hidden by the rank
grass, was an old moss-grown drain pipe.
Putting his lips to it, Danny spoke a few
words. His voice sounded hollow. He slipped
the tubing down into it, and put the end to
his ear.</p>

<p>“Some telephone!” he said, and fairly
wriggled with delight. “So that’s what the
chap was doing last night! The question is,
who was he talking to, and what kind of a
place does this pipe lead to?”</p>

<p>Search as he might he could find no sign of
a cave or any hiding-place in the bank.</p>

<p>“It must be fairly deep,” he said, “or they
wouldn’t want three yards of tubing.”</p>

<p>He poked a stone through the pipe, and
heard it rattle down on to what sounded like
a stone floor some way below. Then he sat
up and considered. They weren’t just common
tramps or poachers, these people he was
after, for they owned a car. They were evidently
afraid the police were on the lookout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
for them, or they would not have changed the
number board and worn false beards!</p>

<p>“There is some connection between this
drain-pipe telephone affair and the mill pond,
and I mean to discover what it is!” said
Danny the Detective.</p>

<p>After making his puzzling discovery of “the
drain-pipe telephone” as he called it, Danny
ran off to make his inspection of the mysterious
pond. Running his eyes quickly over the
bank he soon saw a clue that to the ordinary
person would have meant nothing, but which
revealed something very important to the
“Detective.” On the dusty bank of the pond
there was a wet patch, as if something or
someone had come up out of the water and
stood and dripped for a moment!</p>

<p>The morning shadows had not yet moved
away from the spot and allowed the hot July
sun to dry the ground. Examining the wet
patch more closely, Danny saw that there was
duck-weed on it—the same stuff that dotted
the surface of the pond. There was also some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
black mud—just the kind of slime one would
expect to coat the bottom of the pool.</p>

<p>“So,” said Danny, “the chap who went
down into the pond with his sack <i>did</i> come up
the way he went down. He went down on
Saturday afternoon and he came up in the
night. What’s more, he came up after I had
left the place at 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> I can’t help thinking
he had something to do with the two chaps in
the car.”</p>

<p>The Detective scratched his head. It was
so jolly puzzling.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I missed him. And he’s not here
now, so there’s no good in my staying here,”
he said.</p>

<p>An empty feeling under his Sunday waistcoat
told him that it must be getting near one
o’clock. At dinner his thoughts were far away,
and his mother wondered why he was so silent.
He determined to spend the afternoon having
a long <i>think</i>. He would read up all his notes
and try to put the various clues together and
solve the mystery. He had a particular, secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
place of his own where he always hid when he
wanted to be quiet. It was in the ruins of an
old abbey that stood on the grounds of Sir
Edward Finch’s estate.</p>

<p>The old, grey, half-crumbled buildings stood
quite close to the little lodge where he lived.
No one was allowed to go into this ruin. One
reason was that Sir Edward was a funny old
crank and hated strangers poking about on
his property. Another was that the beautiful
old tower of the church was supposed to be
tottering and about to fall. In fact, two years
ago a man had been killed by a part of the
church falling on him. So a high, barbed-wire
fence surrounded the ruin. The great iron
gates were always kept locked, and no one
ever went in. But one day Danny had discovered
that there was a little wee path that
led from his mother’s cabbage patch to the
hedge that divided the garden from the ruin.
The path was only about ten inches wide.
It must have been made by rabbits, and if
rabbits could get through the hedge and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
barbed-wire into the mysterious old abbey, a
boy could get in, too. So Danny had followed
the path and had soon scrambled through the
thick hedge. To his delight he had found
himself in a fascinating place.</p>

<p>The turf was soft and mossy and full of
harebells. And there was the old grey ruin to
explore. Danny crept about in the traceried
cloisters, where he loved to imagine the holy
monks walking six hundred years ago with
their sandalled feet. There was the room
where he decided they must have had their
meals. But most of all he loved the ruined
church. Somehow it seemed very holy. He
always used to take his cap off when he went
in, though it was open to the blue sky, and
carpeted with wild flowers. One day he had
found a tomtit’s nest built between the mossy
stones where the altar had been.</p>

<p>Now, on this hot sleepy Sunday afternoon
he crept out into the back-garden and filled
his cap with gooseberries. Then he wriggled
through the hedge and had soon curled up in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
warm corner of the cloisters with no one to
see him but the rabbits.</p>

<p>Danny had not had a very restful night,
having been on guard by the pond, and now
the warm sun and his good dinner and the
drowsy hum of the bees in the wild thyme
made him very sleepy and he began to nod.</p>

<p>Before long he was fast asleep, and having a
very strange dream. He thought he was back
in the old days and that he was a knight in
shining armour who had come to the abbey
to pray before going to the Crusades. In his
dream he saw the monks moving about in their
white habits. And then he suddenly saw a
horrid-looking fellow creeping about in the
shadows all dressed in black and hiding a
dagger beneath his wide sleeves.</p>

<p>“A <i>traitor</i>,” said Danny in his dream. And
then he suddenly saw it was the man he had
seen with the bicycle and again in the motor!
Drawing his long sword, he stepped forward,
and—but at this exciting moment he woke
up with a start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Danny, Danny!” someone was shouting.
“Where are you, you young rotter? Danny,
come on, we’re going bathing!”</p>

<p>He started to his feet and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Here I am!” he called, emerging from the
gooseberry bushes as if he had been there all
the time.</p>

<p>His Sixer and two Cubs were waiting for
him. Very soon the four boys were running
gaily off across the marsh with towels round
their necks.</p>

<p>It was only about ten minutes’ run down to
the seashore. Before long the Cubs were
splashing about in the cool green water. It
was ripping! In the old London days Danny
had bathed all the year round in the baths, but
it was not half as jolly as this. All the same,
his swimming-bath experience had been useful,
for he had learnt to swim well, and to dive.</p>

<p>“I can swim and float,” said Sixer Fred
Codding, “but I can’t dive. Show us how
you do it, Daniel.”</p>

<p>Danny ducked down his head, chucked up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
his heels, and vanished. The cool green water
closed over his head. Everything looked so
funny down there—all a lovely pale green
colour, full of myriads of bubbles. Red and
brown seaweed waved lazily on the pebbly
bottom. Danny swam gently forward, looking
for a stone to bring up to show the other
chaps he had really been to the bottom of the
deep pool.</p>

<p>Suddenly, down there in the dim, bubbly
water, among the shells and shrimps and seaweed,
a great idea came to him. He would
dive down into the mill pond himself and see
what there was at the bottom, and why those
strangers were so fond of going down there!
He swam quickly to the surface, his heart
high with resolve. It would take some pluck
to do it. “But a chap’s not worth calling a
Cub if he can’t do a thing like that!” he said
to himself, as he dried vigorously and got into
his clothes again.</p>

<p>Tea was ready when Danny got in. He was
as hungry as a wolf—or rather a Wolf Cub!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
But if he was to go down that day he must go
before the sun set; it was past six already. So
he contented himself with a cup of tea and a
small piece of bread and butter. “I won’t
give in to myself,” he said, thrusting his hands
deep into his pockets, as his mother offered
him a big slice of the most lovely plum cake.</p>

<p>Running up to his room, he changed into a
pair of old shorts, a cotton shirt, and some old
gym. shoes. Then he set out along the well-known
road that had proved to be so full of
mysterious adventures.</p>

<p>There was no sign of any one having been
to the pond since the morning. Still, he could
not be sure. He felt a strange feeling inside
him, as he stood all alone on the bank and
looked down into the water. The evening
sun was shining full on it; he was glad; it
would be easier to see when he was under.
What would there be down there? He
clenched his fists and said the Cub Promise
between his teeth to buck him up. Then he
suddenly remembered his dream and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
brave he had felt when he was a Crusader-knight,
about to challenge the lurking traitor
in the Abbey. Before his courage had time
to fail he dived, straight as an arrow, into the
pond.</p>

<p>It was very different down there from what
it was in the sea. All was a murky, brownish
colour. Black, slimy weeds waved about, like
wicked little clinging hands. He swam about
gently but could see nothing unusual. Soon
he had to come up for more air. Taking a
very big breath, he dived again. This time
he happened to be very near the side. In
order to keep down and look well about him
he caught hold of a big bunch of weed growing
on the wall of the pond. Suddenly, just
before him, he saw a black, cavernous hole
in the bank. It was about three feet across
and seemed like the entrance to a passage,
leading away from the bottom of the pool.
But it was full of water, of course.</p>

<p>Danny rose to the surface for breath, and
ideas crowded into his mind. A passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
leading away from the bottom of the pond!
Then <i>that</i> was where the men went, and where
the bicycle had disappeared to for which they
had dragged the pond so carefully. But why
did not all the water run away? Then he
remembered that water never rises above its
own level. On that side of the pond the bank
rose steeply towards the high ground where
the ruined mill stood. If the passage led up
in a steep incline, or in steps, it would very
soon be on a level with the surface of the pond.
The water, flowing into the passage, would
rise as high as this, and no higher. The level
of the mill and the road was high enough for
the passage to rise beyond the water altogether,
and still be underground. Did it do
this? The only way to find out was to dive
again, swim into the passage, and see! He
would have to take a very big breath to bring
him up where the passage came up, and to let
him get back if it did not seem to be rising. It
was something of a risk. But Danny had
nerved himself to anything. “If I do find a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
passage it will be jolly dark,” he said. And
then he remembered that he had brought his
pocket electric light, and had hidden it, with
his handkerchief, knife, and two pennies, on
the bank before diving. He would take his
light down. Perhaps the water would not
hurt the battery. Scrambling out on to the
edge he soon found his torch, and stowed it
away in the pocket of his shorts. Then, taking
a mighty breath, he dived again, and swam
straight into the dark passage.</p>

<p>Almost at once his outstretched hands came
in contact with something hard and slippery.
It was the bottom step of a flight of stone
stairs. A moment later Danny was half
swimming, half scrambling up them. His
store of air was very nearly exhausted when,
to his intense relief, his head suddenly came
up above the water, and he breathed again.
It was pitch dark, and he was standing in
water up to his neck. He was safe from
drowning, however—that was one thing to be
thankful for! He had reached the top step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
of the flight, and was walking on a slippery
surface that seemed to be inclined uphill, as
he found that before long his shoulders were
out of the water, and then he was only waist-deep.
He took out his electric torch and
pressed the button. To his joy he found the
battery was working, and a ray of golden light
shot through the darkness. Turning the light
from side to side he saw that he was in a low,
vaulted passage, walled and roofed with stone.
There was nothing else to see. The passage
seemed to go straight ahead. There was
nothing for it but to go on, and hope there was
no one else down there!</p>

<p>Danny had not walked many yards before
his light glinted on something. Peering closer
he saw that it was a bicycle leaning up against
the wall. “So that’s where the bike went!”
said Danny triumphantly, wishing the Kangaroos
could see it, as he remembered their
cutting remarks the day they dragged the
pond in vain.</p>

<p>The bicycle was rusty and useless. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
bareheaded stranger who had been in such a
hurry that day on the road, and had said
that he was going one way when he was really
going another, must simply have been flying
from his pursuers, and have thrown his stolen
bicycle into the pond so as not to leave a clue
when he dived down into his wonderful
hiding-place!</p>

<p>So the mystery of the bicycle was solved at
last! Danny had been determined to solve it.
But in working at it he had come on still more
mysterious things. It was a big affair this.
And now he felt himself well on the way to
clearing it up. Had he not got into the most
secret hiding-place of the gang? With his
heart beating fast with excitement he pressed
on along the passage. He had reached dry
ground at last. The air was musty and
suffocating. Danny the Detective thought
that <i>this</i> adventure would solve the whole
problem; he little knew all that was to befall
him and his country before the mystery
would be finally brought to light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>His heart beating fast with excitement,
Danny pressed forward through the damp
darkness. There was a silent horror about this
place. Mildew stood on the walls. Black
creatures scurried away beneath his feet,
afraid of the light. How often Danny had
longed to find a secret passage! But now that
he had really found one he shrank from going
into the unknown darkness. If only there
were another chap to talk to, to feel near!
His teeth chattered with the cold, for he was
soaking wet. But once more he remembered
the Cub Law and did not give in.</p>

<p>“My light won’t last long if I keep it on,”
he said. Flashing it round to see his way, he
noticed a small lantern hanging on the wall
with a box of matches in a little niche. With a
sigh of relief he took it down and lighted it.
The candle light cast weird, flickering shadows
on the wall as Danny hurried on. Every now
and then he lifted the lantern high, looking
about him. He must have gone nearly a
quarter of a mile when, some five feet above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
his head, a faint streak of pale light shone
through a small, round hole in the wall.</p>

<p>“Daylight!” whispered Danny. “I wonder
where that hole goes to.” Then he suddenly
remembered his adventure of 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on Sunday
morning. “Why, that must be the drain-pipe
telephone!” he said. “This is where the man
was who listened at the other end of the pipe
while the one in the ditch talked in a funny
language!”</p>

<p>Danny must have walked about half a mile
when he was brought up short by a flight of
stone steps. Mounting these, he found himself
face to face with a low door made of some hard,
black wood, studded thickly with iron nails
and bands, red with rust. There was a massive
lock and two heavy bolts. The bolts were not
across the door, and Danny stepped forward
eagerly, hoping that he would be able to open
it. But, try as he would, the door baffled all
his efforts. Cold and weary and disappointed
he had at last to give up the task. There was
nothing for it but to go back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>After a long, dark walk he reached the end
of the passage once more and hung the lantern
up on its hook. Then, bracing himself for
the effort, he plunged again into the black
water.</p>

<p>The sun had just set in a glory of red and
gold when Danny rose from the mill pool.
The air of the summer evening was warm after
the icy, tomb-like atmosphere of the passage.
It was an infinite relief to see daylight again,
and a comfort to hear the birds singing their
goodnight songs, and to feel there were live
things about. Wringing the water from his
clothes, he set out for home at a brisk trot.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Danny,” said his Sixer the next
morning, as the boys hurried to school,
“where on earth were you last night? You
didn’t half miss something. All us chaps were
paddling down on the beach, in front of the
‘Blue Boar,’ when an artist-chap came up and
started painting.”</p>

<p>“An artist?” said Danny, all interest at
once, for, after being a detective, the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
thing Danny wanted most in the world to be
was an artist.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Codding, “and he wasn’t half
a decent chap either. He let us come as close
as we liked and watch him. And he gave us
old ends of pencils and crayons and bits of
paper. He’s staying at the ‘Blue Boar,’ ’cos
he wants to draw heaps of pictures round here.
And he said we might come and see him again
this evening.”</p>

<p>So, after tea, quite a little crowd of Cubs
collected round the artist, who was as friendly
as ever. After a time most of them drifted off,
and Danny was left alone. The stranger,
seeing his interest, gave him a nice, clean piece
of paper and some old paints and let him have
a try.</p>

<p>A week passed, and every evening he would
run down and squat on the ground by the
artist, drawing. And while they drew the
artist asked him lots of questions about
Dutton, and the people, and the country
round. Danny, being a Wolf Cub, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
delighted to answer them all, promptly and
politely, and, if he did not know the necessary
information, did his best to find it out for his
new friend. When he was tired of drawing
he would look at the sketch-books the artist
kept in his satchel. The pictures were mostly
of harbours and hills and fields. One day he
came on one that puzzled him.</p>

<p>“What a funny one this is!” he said.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the artist. “I’ll tell you why
that one looks funny. It is because I was
sitting right up on the top of a very high
church tower when I drew that. And, looking
down, all the country was spread round me
like a map, and I looked down on the roofs of
the houses and the tops of the trees.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Danny, “I see!” He was just
looking at a funny little sketch he had found
in an inner pocket of the satchel. It was of
Dutton, and showed the harbour and the
church and the Village, and the roads all
round. And it was very much like the one
done from the church tower. It puzzled him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
because Dutton Church had a spire and no
one could sit up on that and paint!</p>

<p>“It’s very funny,” said Danny thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“What’s funny?” asked the artist.</p>

<p>“This sketch. You must have been up
somewhere high when you drew it. But we
have no church tower here.”</p>

<p>The artist dropped his pencil and turned
round quickly on Danny.</p>

<p>“What d’you mean?” he said sharply.
“What sketch? Give it to me.” And he
snatched it out of the boy’s hand and, folding
it, put it in his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>Danny looked keenly at the man. Why
was he so flurried and excited? His detective
instinct smelt a rat at once.</p>

<p>“Where did you sit, sir, when you did that
sketch?” he asked with innocent eyes resting
on the artist’s face.</p>

<p>“I, oh—I don’t remember,” said the man.</p>

<p>“But you must have been up high somewhere.”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t,” said the artist shortly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
changed the subject. But Danny was not to
be put off so easily. He meant to find out
why his friend had suddenly turned “snuffy,”
and why he had told a lie, for any one could
see the sketch had been drawn from above.
Sitting silently on the ground, Danny thought
deeply. Could it have been drawn from the
roof of the Hall? No!—for the Hall and its
lake and gardens came into the picture.
There was only one other high building in
Dutton—the ruined tower of the Abbey. The
man must have done his sketch from there!
But how had he got up? And why was he so
mysterious about it?</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Danny, “how did you manage
to get up the tower to do that sketch? The
door is always locked and the tower is
dangerous.”</p>

<p>The man started at the question, and looked
closely at Danny, a frown on his face.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” he said.
“Run along, now, and don’t go on bothering
me—I’m busy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Of course Danny examined the door of the
tower, but, as usual, it was locked, and there
were no signs that any one had broken into
the Abbey ruins. But before long he had
made a curious discovery about his artist
friend. Another friend of Danny’s—a fisherman—had
promised to take him out on a
fishing expedition, if he could manage to
wake up, and get to his cottage by 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> It
was terribly early to have to get up, but, with
the help of an alarum clock, Danny managed
to wake. The whole Village seemed fast asleep
as he crept out into the chill, dewy morning.
Not a soul was about. He was trotting along
the road at “scouts’ pace,” whistling, when,
to his surprise, he suddenly saw the artist
walking quickly towards him!</p>

<p>“Hullo, sir!” he cried, with friendly pleasure.</p>

<p>But the artist had started on seeing the Cub,
and was not looking over-pleased at this early-morning
encounter.</p>

<p>Scanning the man with curious eyes, Danny
noticed that his rough tweed suit looked wet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
To make sure, he took hold of the artist’s
arm, as if by a friendly impulse. Sure, enough,
his coat was wringing wet, and, peering more
closely, Danny saw little scraps of duck-weed
sticking to it. His thoughts flew at once to
the mill pond.</p>

<p>But before Danny had had time to think
much of this discovery, his quick eyes had
noted something else.</p>

<p>“Look, sir,” he said, “you’ve torn a big piece
out of your coat! And one of the buttons,
too!” The artist glanced down.</p>

<p>“So I have,” he said, a little uneasily.
Then he hurried on, and Danny was left standing
in the road. He gave up his idea of going
fishing and decided to go on the trail again.
Here was a new, important clue—the friendly
artist, so full of questions and kindness, was
one of the stealthy gang!</p>

<p>He determined to go to the pool and find
out where and how the man had torn such a
great piece out of his coat.</p>

<p>As he passed the drain pipe in the ditch, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
paused and looked at it. He was standing
on the bank, his hand resting on a telegraph-pole,
when something made him glance up.
Just above his head, a torn scrap of cloth, with
a button sewn to it, was hanging on a bent
nail in the post.</p>

<p>Reaching up, Danny unhooked it. Yes, it
was the artist’s button! So he had been climbing
a telegraph-pole! What on earth for?
Danny was more puzzled than ever. But it
was certainly a “clue,” and he logged it in
his notebook, with the other particulars concerning
the artist.</p>

<p>The pool revealed no more secrets, except
that someone had certainly climbed out of it
lately, and left wet marks on the bank.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_076a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_076a.jpg" alt="You’ve torn a big piece out of your coat">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“Look, sir,” he said, “you’ve torn a big piece out of your coat! And
one of the buttons, too!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“My word, but I won’t half keep a sharp
lookout on that chap,” said Danny to himself,
as he walked home. But he had two
pieces of news to learn when he reached
Dutton. One was that the artist and his
portmanteau had departed in a cart for the
station; and the other that the newspapers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>had very serious news in them. The quarrel
between Germany and the Balkan States that
had been attracting attention was spreading
to something wider. “It will end in a great
war,” people said. In a few days came the
news that Germany had broken all treaties,
and was trampling on little Belgium. England,
standing for fair play, <i>must</i> come in. On
August 4th, England had declared war on
Germany.</p>

<p>“If only we could <i>do</i> something,” everybody
felt. The Dutton Scouts and Wolf Cubs fairly
ramped with impatience to be called out on war
service. Their chance came sooner than they
expected. And sooner than he expected came
the solution to the great mystery that had
puzzled Danny the Detective for so long.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>SPIES!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Four</span> days after war was declared, on August
8th, a motor-bike dashed into the village,
and from it jumped the District Commissioner.
Before long, he, the Scoutmaster,
and three of the Patrol-Leaders were shut
into the Scout Headquarters; the Cubs
hung about outside, longing to know what
was on.</p>

<p>The Commissioner’s news was that the War
Office urgently called on Scouts to guard the
trunk cable-line from being tapped or cut in
a certain area, day and night, at once, until
further orders. German spies were suspected
of tampering with most important telegraph
wires. Government secrets were getting out,
wrong messages were coming through. Also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
messages were somehow getting through to
Germany.</p>

<p>The Dutton Scouts were to patrol six
miles of the road. The three Patrol-Leaders
dashed off on their bikes. In an hour, the
troop, in full kit, was patrolling the road and
ready to challenge any doubtful person.</p>

<p><i>Spies!</i> The very word thrilled Danny.
And suddenly his heart stood still, and then
went on at a great rate. Spies? That was it.
His mysterious strangers were German spies,
and they had some secret way of communicating
with Germany!</p>

<p>The hot afternoon sun beat down on the
dusty road that wound like a long white ribbon
between the fields and woods. Two and two,
the Scouts marched up and down, each couple
along their allotted distance. With keen eyes
they scanned the face of every passer-by.
Now and then they challenged a person of
doubtful appearance.</p>

<p>Once the excitement was great, when a disreputable-looking
man utterly refused to answer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and tried to pass on, as if he had not
heard. The two Ravens took him in charge,
and marched him off to the police station.
But, after all, he turned out to be a deaf and
dumb tramp, well known in the neighbouring
workhouse.</p>

<p>“You were quite right to take him up,”
said the Commissioner, when he heard of this.
“At such times we must take no risks.”</p>

<p>It was hot work patrolling the roads. The
Ravens and Lions took on the day duty, and
the Otters and Kangaroos, in charge of Senior
Patrol-Leader Church, were told off for the
still more important night work. The Cubs
looked on with longing eyes. Could they do
nothing?</p>

<p>Before long their turn came. They were
entrusted with the distributing of rations
to the Scouts on duty. Two Sixes undertook
the food, and the two others the drink; and
the thirsty Scouts were indeed glad of it.
But the Cubs’ proudest moment came when
the order was issued that the Scouts—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Patrol at a time—should knock off duty for
half an hour, for tea, and that Cubs should
take their place, and patrol the road in company
with the Scout left on duty, one out
of each couple. It was service for the King!
They were guarding England from the Germans,
and helping to keep her secrets from
the enemy! Each Cub’s heart swelled with
pride, as he marched by the side of his Scout.</p>

<p>He could almost imagine that a rifle with
a fixed bayonet rested on his shoulder. Behind
every tree he <i>almost</i> saw a German. He
simply itched to say, “Halt! Who goes
there?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>A WHITE FACE IN THE MOONLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> meanwhile, what of Danny! Was he
sharing in the pride and joy of the Pack, in
its important work? No; Danny was not
feeling very cheerful, for he was conscious
that for the first time since he had been a Cub
he was failing to do his duty. Why? Because
he was <i>giving in to himself</i>, to his own pride
and ambition, and thinking of his own glory
before the safety of his country.</p>

<p>Here he was, knowing a large number of
important particulars about a dangerous gang
of spies. He knew their hiding-places; their
footprints; the faces and appearance of several
of them. He knew mysterious things
about them that he did not understand. His
country was in great peril; the Scouts were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
called out to try and catch these very Germans—while
he kept his secret to himself.
A voice inside him said:</p>

<p>“Danny, it’s your duty to go and report all
you know to the police, at once.”</p>

<p>But Danny frowned, and answered: “I
won’t. If I do that, the police and the soldiers
and the Scouts will take all my clues that I’ve
spent months in finding, and they will catch
the spies, and have all the fun and get all the
honour and glory. They are <i>my spies</i>—I will
catch them myself. And all the beastly people
who laughed at me and said I was telling
lies will see I really am a detective. And
p’raps the King will hear about me.”</p>

<p>But still the voice inside him said: “A Cub
does not give in to himself. England is in
danger—what does it matter if you get the
glory or not, as long as her enemies are
caught?” But Danny would not listen. He
felt sure his great chance had come. To-night
he would solve the mystery, and catch
the spies red-handed. Once he had found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
them at it—<i>then</i> he would not mind calling
the Scouts or police to his help. But he felt
very unhappy inside, as people always do who
do wrong with their eyes open, and on purpose.</p>

<p>Danny had meant to stay out all night looking
for the spies. But, as luck would have it,
his mother caught him as he was creeping out,
at nine o’clock, and packed him off to bed,
locking his bedroom door. He decided at
once to get out of the window. But, oh,
bother!—there was his mother talking over
the garden gate to Mrs. Jones from next door.</p>

<p>He waited and waited, but they would not
go away. Tired out, he decided to lie down on
his bed for a little while, and get out as soon
as he heard their voices stop and knew the
coast was clear. But when you are very sleepy,
and lie down on your bed, the chances are
that you fall fast asleep. And this is exactly
what Danny did.</p>

<p>The church clock was striking twelve when
he awoke with a start and sat up. Why was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
he lying on his bed in uniform? Then he remembered.
“Slack little beast,” he called
himself. He had slept instead of going out
spy-hunting! He jumped off his bed, feeling
about for his cap.</p>

<p>Hark! What was that? A deep, distant
humming. Was it a motor car on the road?
No, it seemed to come from above! It must
be an aeroplane. Softly Danny crept to the
window. Yes, the whirring, humming sound
certainly came down faintly from high, high
up in the starry, purple sky. Perhaps it was
a German aeroplane!</p>

<p>Danny’s eyes were fixed on that part of the
sky whence the sound seemed to come. This
happened to be exactly over the tower of the
ruined Abbey, whose black outline stood out
distinctly against the stars. Suddenly, like
a faint flicker of summer lightning, a white
glow appeared for a moment over the tower,
as if a bright light had been flashed further
down, inside, only visible from above. And
between the cracks of the half-ruined walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Danny saw a gleam shine for a moment, and
then go out. The detective had had his suspicions
about that tower ever since the day
he had decided that the artist-spy must have
been up there. And yet he had not been able
to discover anything about it. Now he was
certain something was wrong.</p>

<p>The German spies were there, up in the
tower!</p>

<p>They had flashed a light in signal to the
aeroplane. Even as he listened breathless,
the aeroplane buzzed, as if putting on a higher
speed, and then sped off in a southerly direction.</p>

<p>“I’ve got you,” hissed Danny, between his
clenched teeth, as he climbed out of the
window, and down the rose-covered porch.</p>

<p>He meant to try and find out something
more from the ruined Abbey, and then make
his report to the Scouts on the night patrol.
He, the detective, would lead them to the
tower, where his prisoners would be caught
like rats in a trap. He would show them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
secret passage in the pond. He would explain
the drain-pipe telephone. He would identify
the prisoners. There would be the bicycle
man, and the other in the motor car, and the
tramp, and the artist. He, Danny, would be
the hero of this adventure.</p>

<p>With beating heart, he crept down the
kitchen garden and between the gooseberry
bushes. Through the hedge he crawled, and
out on to the mossy turf. It was soaking
wet with dew. The pale moonlight shone
down on the Abbey, giving it a mysterious
air, and casting very black shadows. Suddenly
Danny remembered his dream. So it
was coming true! There was a “traitor” in
the Abbey ruin. And he must prove himself
to be the gallant crusader of his dream. He
gripped the stick he was holding, and it seemed
to him to be a long, bright sword. He glanced
down at himself, half expecting to see the
red Cross of St. George on his breast, the shining
armour. But there was only a green jersey
and bare, brown knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Yet, I <i>am</i> a knight of St. George—all
Scouts and Wolf Cubs are,” he told himself.
“Oh, help me to be brave!” he whispered as
he stole forward into the shadows. And truly
he had need of help—more need than he
knew.</p>

<p>Stepping softly into the dark cloisters,
Danny held his breath and listened. There
was no sound. Slowly he advanced to the
door of the tower. Here he flashed on his electric
light. The door was fast shut. Then,
on the stone floor of the cloister something
caught his eye,—wet footprints, as if someone
had walked from the dewy grass, on to the
smooth grey flags! Kneeling on the ground
Danny examined them. They led to the door.
Where did they lead <i>from</i>? Here was a
chance of discovering how the spies had entered
the ruin.</p>

<p>Looking about him warily, Danny crept forward
into the darkness, flashing on his light
for a moment now and then to see that he was
still on the track. About twelve yards on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the footprints suddenly ceased. Glancing
around to discover the cause of this, Danny
saw that there was a large, jagged hole in the
wall, at about the height of his shoulder. The
man must have dropped through this into
the cloister. In a moment he had clambered
through, and found himself standing in the
moonlight in that part of the ruin known as
the Abbot’s Garden. Beneath his feet was
long, dew-soaked grass. How could he discover
from what direction the spy had come?
Tracking was impossible. He was stumped.</p>

<p>After all, delay might be causing serious
danger. He had better retrace his steps
quickly, get out of the Abbey, and go to make
his report that the spies were in the tower.
Turning round to climb back through the hole
in the wall, Danny came face to face with
something that nearly made his hair stand
on end!</p>

<p>Exactly behind him, peering through the
hole in the wall, was an evil face, the two small
pale eyes gleaming in the moonlight; the barrel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
of a revolver, like a round, black, hollow eye
fixed on him in a deathlike stare.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” hissed the man. Standing
quite still Danny met the small, blue eyes so
intent upon him, and slowly his hands went up.
It all felt like a dream; it was, again, the face
of the “traitor”—the face of the stranger with
the bicycle.</p>

<p>It seemed hours before the man spoke again,
and all the time the black, vacant eye of the
revolver seemed to be staring at a spot in the
middle of Danny’s forehead.</p>

<p>“Stand still and speak not one word!”
whispered the man, and began to climb through
the hole, keeping the revolver pointed at
Danny, the while. Then, without a word, he
took him firmly by the collar, tapping the
back of his head with the pistol.</p>

<p>“It’s loaded,” he whispered. “If you call
out or try and run away, I shoot. Now, walk
with me, quietly!”</p>

<p>With the cold barrel against the back of
his neck, there was nothing for it but to obey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Cold sweat broke out on Danny’s forehead,
as together the strange pair walked silently
over the grass, in the shadow of the ruined
walls.</p>

<p>Their feet made no sound on the long, wet
grass as they walked across the Abbot’s Garden,
keeping in the black shadow cast by the
half-ruined walls of the church. Danny seemed
almost stunned. He could not fully realise
the horror of his position. He found himself
vaguely admiring the delicate shadows cast
on the grass as the moonlight poured down
through the Gothic traceries of the windows.
In his ear he heard the quick breathing of
the spy. The cold barrel of the revolver
touched his neck. The man’s fingers gripped
the collar of his jersey and forced him to walk
on. Was it a horrible dream, or was he really
alone, defenceless, and in the power of a dangerous
enemy?</p>

<p>They had stepped quickly across the brilliant
“moonlit space,” and stood now in the shadow
of the Abbot’s House—a low, square building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
standing away from the rest of the ruin. The
arch over the doorway had fallen in, blocking it
up completely. Ivy grew thick on the walls.
On a level with Danny’s head was the sill of
a Gothic window. Slipping the revolver into
his coat pocket, the German lifted Danny by
the back of his belt, and, swinging him up,
dropped him through the dark aperture of the
window. He fell on his hands and knees on the
stone floor, rough with pieces of broken stone.
Though bruised and cut, he jumped up quickly.
Was there a chance of escape before that cruel
hand was on his shoulder again, the revolver
threatening certain death?</p>

<p>He glanced up at the window. But even at
that moment the grey patch of sky was
blocked out by the form of a man climbing
through. A moment later the spy dropped on
to the ground, and his groping hands touched
Danny’s face as he crouched, trembling, in a
corner. Grasping his wrist in a grip like steel,
the spy dragged him across the dark room,
muttering an oath in German as he tripped on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
a large stone. Stopping suddenly, he seemed
to be feeling his way. Then Danny found
himself being led down some steps and
through a doorway.</p>

<p>His eyes ached with trying to pierce the
darkness, he longed to see where he was. But
it startled him considerably when a bright
ray of light shot through the gloom. The spy
had turned on a brilliant electric torch.</p>

<p>By its light Danny saw that they were in a
small, vaulted cellar, damp earth beneath
their feet. There seemed no way out of this
narrow place, except up the stairs they had
just descended. But even as Danny noted
this the man turned his light on to the stone
wall and revealed to view a low, rusty door.</p>

<p>Taking a large key from his pocket, he inserted
this in the lock and turned it with a
grating sound. Slowly the heavy door swung
inwards, its hinges giving forth a weird groan
that brought to Danny’s mind all the horrors
he had ever read of or imagined concerning
dungeons and subterranean prisons. Gripping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
his arm, the spy dragged him through the
low archway, and, turning, shut the door
and locked it. Glancing quickly about him,
Danny recognised the place at once. It was
the passage he had discovered leading from
the mill pool. This iron-studded door was the
one that had baffled all his efforts when he
had tried to open it from the inside.</p>

<p>Once in the underground passage the man
seemed to lose all fear, and dropped his cautious
manner. Turning on Danny he poured
forth a torrent of abuse, half in German, half
in English. Then, with a savage kick, he
flung him on to the ground. After standing
for a moment as if considering what to do
next, he drew from his pocket a piece of stout
cord. Cutting this into two, he knelt down
and tied Danny’s feet securely together.
Forcing the boy’s hands behind his back, he
knotted the cord about his wrists. Then he
stood over Danny, a sardonic grin on his face.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, with a snarling laugh,
“there, young Scout, or what you call yourself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
no more harm will you be able now to do.”
Turning on his heel, he walked a few paces
down the passage and then came back, as if
a thought had struck him. Taking a large,
silk handkerchief from his pocket, he gagged
his young prisoner.</p>

<p>“There, little English pig!” he said. “Now
you will disturb no one.” And with a cruel
laugh, he walked quickly away.</p>

<p>Turning his head, Danny watched the retreating
figure from where he lay on the cold
stone floor. He gazed at the dancing light of
the torch until it grew fainter and fainter,
and suddenly disappeared round a corner.
Then in the lonely darkness a great sob rose
in his throat—a sob of despair.</p>

<p>He was alone, quite alone, underground.
His feet were tied so that he could not get up,
his hands bound so that he could not move.
There seemed no possible way of escape.
Would he be left here to die of cold and
starvation? Or would the spies come back
and do something horrible to him? The silence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
seemed to throb and sing in his ears. His eyes
ached with peering into the darkness. And,
lying there, he realised the sad truth that he
had brought it all on himself. Why had he
been such a little fool and tried to catch
these Germans single-handed? For the sake
of his own glory he had risked the safety of
England. Out of personal pride he had withheld
important information. And now here
he was lying helpless and useless, while from
the tower the spies were signalling to the
enemy, and this man was escaping—or setting
out, perhaps, to tamper with the cables
in some mysterious way, and so send England’s
secrets to the Kaiser!</p>

<p>There was no one now to warn the police.
He had been given the chance to serve his
country, and he had not taken it; he had “given
in to himself.” Laying his face on the cold
floor, he gave up all hope, and a big, hot tear
rolled down his cheek.</p>

<p>But there was still a spark of courage in
his heart; a bit of pluck that always remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
in <i>a Scout</i> when all the spirit of the ordinary
boy has gone. He was a <i>Cub</i>; he <i>would</i> not
give in. “O God,” he whispered in the damp
darkness, “give me another chance. I will
not fail this time. I will do my duty. I will
not give in to myself.”</p>

<p>Rolling against the wall, his face struck on
the sharp corner of a projecting stone. A
brilliant idea came into his head! Wriggling
himself round as best he could, he managed
to get the cord that bound his wrists against
the sharp stone. Then, scraping and sawing,
he set to work to cut through the rope. It
was a long job and a painful one. Soon he
felt the warm blood trickling down his sleeves.
The pain made him feel quite sick. At last
he felt he must give up. But, remembering
he was a Cub, he clenched his teeth and determined
that no pain or fear should break
his courage. Suddenly the cord gave, and
Danny found his hands free!</p>

<p>It was the work of a moment to untie his
feet. Feeling that the battle was already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
half won, he jumped up, his heart full of
joy and gratitude. God was giving him
another chance. He was to find a way of
escape. Taking his little torch from his
pocket, he pressed the button, and a ray of
light pierced the darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>TAPPING THE CABLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing that Danny noticed was something
that had not been there before when he
had explored the passage. It was something
that had happened since the German had
gone away with the light.</p>

<p>It was a great crack in the stone wall!</p>

<p>A huge stone—the very one he had been
pushing and rubbing against to cut his bonds—had
shifted its position. Here, surely, was
the opening to a secret way out of the passage!
Pushing the stone gently Danny found that it
swung round on a pivot, just allowing room
for a man to pass.</p>

<p>Stepping through, he flashed his light about
him. He was in a great, arched vault.</p>

<p>Hanging on a pillar just in front of him was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
a lantern, containing a candle end, and a box
of matches. Thankfully Danny took this
down from its hook, for already the light was
getting faint—the battery was giving out.
Lighting the lantern he held it aloft. As its
yellow light flickered in the dark corners, and
between the massive pillars, a sight met his
eyes that sent a thrill of horror and excitement
through his heart.</p>

<p>Standing in the narrow aperture of the secret
door, Danny gazed in fascinated horror at the
scene.</p>

<p>Before him a great, low hall stretched away
into the darkness, so that he could not see
the end of it. Massive pillars supported the
vaulted roof, which was not more than eight
feet high. And amid the dust, and the sense
of old days long gone by, of a dead, forgotten
past, he had come all unexpectedly on war
and its most deadly instruments lurking,
hiding, and, somehow, terribly alive and
modern.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe43_6875" id="i_100a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_100a.jpg" alt="There lay a vast store of machine guns">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">There, row upon row, shining, perfect, ready for use, lay a vast store of machine guns.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For there, row upon row, shining, perfect,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>ready for use, lay a vast store of machine
guns. In the yellow light of the guttering
candle they seemed to fix a hundred black
and hollow eyes upon the boy, like so many
traitors startled in their hiding-place. Belts
of ammunition lay like piles of coiled snakes;
cases, boxes, rose in pyramids to the roof.
Rifles were stacked against the wall.</p>

<p>A kind of helpless horror filled Danny. It
was all so tremendous, so prepared, so very,
very unexpected. His knees knocked together,
his heart seemed to thump against his
ribs. A great lump rose in his throat. And
then, as he gazed with a kind of numb horror,
the truth crept into his mind that this great
army of death-dealing implements was not
alive; was, in fact, weak, useless, powerless.
That <i>he</i> was <i>alive</i>! That he, in his small self,
had more power than all these guns, for he had
life, will, a human brain, and courage. These
traitorous slaves of Germany must cower before
him; he had found them out; and surely
he had found them out <i>in time</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>The detective instinct in him tempted him
to explore the vault. But the voice of duty
had become the loudest in Danny’s ears at
last. Curiosity and ambition must have no
say. He had been trusted with a momentous
secret. Over England hung the possibility of
a great catastrophe. Here was his duty—to
get out of this place without a single moment’s
delay, to make his report as clearly as possible
to those who could take action. With
his life he would guard this secret; and if the
carrying of it, the delivering of it, cost him his
life, he would not be afraid to offer it. He
had not taken his chance when it was easy.
Now that it was hard, nothing would hold
him back. But caution as well as courage
was necessary. Turning round, he entered
the passage once more and began to walk
quickly and as silently as possible in the
wake of the German spy.</p>

<p>A mile of passage lay before him. At the
end of it the steps descended, as he knew, into
the chill waters of the pool. He would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
to descend these steps. Gradually the water
would creep up to his knees, his waist, his neck.
A big breath, a duck, four, five, six strong
strokes, and his head would be above the surface,
he would be breathing the pure air of
the upper world; he would be free!</p>

<p>And yet, what lay between him and this
freedom? He knew not at all. He dared not
try to imagine. But bracing up his spirit with
a brave determination to forget self and put
duty first, he pressed on. If his heart quailed, it
was at the thought of entering the black water.
What if he met an enemy down there? So
intent was his mind upon this possible horror
that he was startled and taken aback at the
strange sight and sound that reached him
simultaneously as he rounded a sharp bend
in the passage.</p>

<p>“Buzz, buzz, buzz-buzz, buzz!” broke on
his ears. And there, some twenty yards away,
stood the German who had captured him an
hour ago. He was standing half-turned away,
wholly intent upon an apparatus fixed on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
wall. From this the buzzing sound proceeded.
Several wires rose from it, up the wall, disappearing
through the round hole that Danny
had discovered before as the drain pipe by
which the spies talked together through the
speaking-tube.</p>

<p>Now he realised at once that something far
worse was on foot than a mere conversation
with a fellow-spy in a ditch. The man was
using a telegraph apparatus. He was doing
that which the police had feared might happen,
and which the Scouts had been called out
to prevent, namely, tapping the cables—listening
here in his safe hiding-place to the secret
communications of England’s statesmen; substituting
in their place false messages.</p>

<p>A kind of impetuous rage filled Danny. He
clenched his fists, and his whole body quivered
with a desire to throw himself, tooth and nail
upon this spy, eavesdropping, sucking in
England’s secrets. But what was he, a little
boy, against this man—armed, as he knew,
with a revolver? Yes, there lay the sinister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
little weapon on the shelf that held the
candle.</p>

<p>Danny’s first impulse on seeing the enemy
had been to drop to the ground, at the same
time extinguishing his candle. Now he squatted
hidden by the darkness, his eyes fixed in
fascinated horror on the scene. Following
up the wires with his eyes to where they disappeared
through the pipe, he asked himself
how they could be connected with the cable.
Then, like a flash, he remembered the telegraph-pole
that rose from out a mass of nettles
quite close to the drain. Before him rose the
picture of the artist-spy, on that sunny morning
at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, coming along the road with a
piece torn off his coat, and the finding of the
piece hooked on the nail in the post a few
minutes later. That was the day before war
was declared.</p>

<p>Clue was fitting into clue like the pieces of
a jig-saw puzzle. The detective’s heart beat
fast with excitement. Then, like a cold hand
crushing the hope out of him, came the realisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
that the man with the buzzer stood full
in his path, preventing him from reaching the
end of the passage with the steps and the water
that led to freedom. He was balked!</p>

<p>Never before in his life had Danny so longed
to be a man, to be big and strong and a match
for this spy. Then he would have crept up the
passage and, springing on the man, grappled
with him, flinging him to the ground there to
leave him, bound and helpless while he made
his escape, and bore his secret safe with
him.</p>

<p>But what chance would a boy have against
this enemy? Danny did not lack courage for
the attempt, but he well knew that it would
be a throwing away of all possible chance of
escape. To sacrifice himself thus would do
no good whatever. The spy would be free
to go on with his terrible enterprise. The
secret Danny alone knew, would die with him.
It would be much wiser to retire, and seek for
some other way of exit from the passage.</p>

<p>Sometimes action, with its element of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
excitement, with the invigorating spirit of
sacrifice that accompanies it, is much easier
than a safer, wiser course. It was hard for Danny
to turn his back on this dangerous enemy of
his country, to leave him unmolested at his
eavesdropping, and to creep back along half
a mile of passage. Yet, to seek for every
possible chance of getting out and making
known the facts to the military was his clear
duty. He had not yet explored the vault;
there might possibly be a way of escape
through this.</p>

<p>Pushing the heavy stone of the secret entrance
to the vault, Danny crept once more into the
mysterious place, holding aloft his lantern.
On every hand guns, rifles, cases of ammunition
surrounded him. All was so silent and horrible,
and yet so sinister and alive. Suddenly he
started, a gasp of horror rising in his
throat.</p>

<p>There, in the yellow light of his candle, he
saw a prostrate figure, lying motionless, upon
what looked like a low, stone bench. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
clothed in a long, crimson robe; gold glittered
here and there upon it. Drawing nearer, and
struggling with his fear, he saw, to his relief,
that it was but an image—a carving of some
saintly bishop long dead, his white hands folded
peacefully upon his breast, his mitre on his
head.</p>

<p>This, then, was the crypt of the Abbey
Church. Danny drew near, and looked reverently
at the carving of the peaceful holy old
face. Here, too, lay a prince, in blue and
ermine and a crown. There, behind a pillar,
was the effigy of a white-robed father—a pile
of rifles had been propped against his tomb.
Further on was a little chapel, the altar
still standing.</p>

<p>Somehow it all comforted Danny, making
him feel less alone, giving him a sense of unseen
protection. Filled with a new courage
and confidence he stepped forward.</p>

<p>How strange in this holy place to find a
store of German weapons! Five hundred years
it had laid hidden, to be discovered at last by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
the enemy and used as a storehouse of munitions
of war. Quietly Danny began his search for
a way out, and before long he was rewarded.</p>

<p>A wooden door, in the corner of the crypt,
stood ajar. Passing through this, Danny found
himself in a small room.</p>

<p>From it led what once must have been the
staircase up into the church. But this was
now broken, and completely choked with
stones and pieces of fallen masonry. On
the opposite side of the room the wall was
cracked and broken. In one place a crevice
yawned, wide enough to let a man creep
through into the darkness beyond. Leaning
through this, Danny strained his eyes to try
and pierce the gloom. There was nothing to
see, but against his hot face he felt a cool wind
blowing. It was altogether different from the
heavy, suffocating atmosphere of the passage
and crypt. Instead of the mouldy smell that
had reached his nostrils, Danny was conscious
of the pungent, salty odour that is borne on
a sea breeze!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>It filled his heart with hope. Holding aloft
his lantern, he climbed through the opening,
and stepped forward over the rough and stony
floor.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>FREE!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> narrow place Danny had clambered into
seemed more like a crevice than a passage.
In parts the rough walls were so close together
that he could only just pass. Further
on, he had to bend his head, so low was the
rocky roof. In another place a craggy boulder
had to be climbed over, and a deep crack
jumped across. And ever the cool breeze
fanned his face, making his candle flare and
gutter. As he stopped to listen, a faint sound
reached his ears, a kind of sigh. As he pressed
onwards the sound increased.</p>

<p>“The sea!” he whispered.</p>

<p>And then, through the dense blackness
ahead, a grey patch showed, pricked here and
there with a faint star. A rush of joy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
relief filled Danny’s heart. Fresh air! The
upper world again!</p>

<p>Hurrying over the rough floor he reached
the opening in the rocky wall, and stepped
out on to a ledge, very narrow, very perilous.
Away before him stretched a vast expanse of
sea, heaving and shimmering in the pale light
of dawn. Taking a great breath of the cold,
salty air, Danny looked about him.</p>

<p>Below him the cliff dropped smooth and
precipitous, to where the green water churned
and foamed among sharp points of rock. The
grey wall above his head ran skywards, straight
and smooth. There was no way up or down.
And in front the lonely sea tossed and foamed,
with never a boat in sight.</p>

<p>Sea gulls swooped about, with their sad,
sharp cries—their gleaming, silver wings seeming
to mock the boy, prisoner on a ledge that
was to them but a resting-place.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_112a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_112a.jpg" alt="He stepped out on to a ledge">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">He stepped out on to a ledge, very narrow, very perilous.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once again Danny came very near to despair.
A wild recklessness seized him. He would
jump down into that churning foam and water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and hope for the best; hope that he would
not strike a rock. It was the only thing to
do. He could almost feel himself falling,
falling through the cold air, feel the shock
of the splash into the foaming sea far below.
There was something exhilarating about it.
He would probably be killed. Oh, it would
be a relief from the horror of the last few
hours! And he would be dying for his country!</p>

<p>With the thought of his country, however,
he returned to a saner mood. No, that
was all rot. To hurl yourself to useless destruction
is not to die for your country. He
had a great secret to carry and deliver, so as
to save England. He knew that there was only
about one chance in a thousand that if he
jumped down he would ever be able to reach
the shore in safety. It was not for him to
take risks. His heart sank as he realised the
only course left to him—for to shout for help
would be useless: this was a lonely place at
best, and there was no chance of any one
being near at dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“I must go back.”</p>

<p>He spoke the words aloud. And his voice
sounded weak and shaky. Oh, the horror of
going back into that nightmare of dark passages
and vaults! But it was his duty. Here, there
was no chance of escape; there, there might
possibly be.</p>

<p>“It’s more horrible to go back than to
jump down into the sea,” he said, “but I’ll
do it for England’s sake, and to keep my
promise to do my duty, and not give in to
myself.”</p>

<p>Clenching his fists tight, he turned his back
on the sea and faced the darkness. Why had
he come here if it was all for no purpose? Even
as he wondered this, his eye fell on something
that gave him the answer. In a cranny in the
wall three objects were stowed: a powerful
telescope, a signalling flag, and a strong flashlight.
So the spies, also, had discovered this
ledge! To whom did they mean to signal?
Obviously to someone out to sea—to a submarine—a
stealthy scout, sent from some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
enemy squadron lying out in a bank of mist;
the picture rose in Danny’s mind.</p>

<p>Picking up the telescope, he scanned the
sea, half expecting to see a little black point—a
periscope—watching, watching for the
expected signal. There was nothing in view;
but he had made an important discovery,
namely that such a watching scout was
expected by the spies; that they had made
arrangements to signal across the sea, as well
as by the other means Danny had discovered.
To have learnt this important piece of information
made his difficult task of getting to the
cliff worth while; the time so expended had not
been time lost. Danny knew now why he had
been led thither. With this added information
to report, he was more than ever impatient
to be out—more full of hope and determination.</p>

<p>Back along the rocky crack he went; back
through the crypt; back into the passage. For
the second time he hurried silently along it.
At the place where it turned a sharp corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
he paused to listen, breathlessly. Yes, there
it was—“buzz, buzz-buzz, buzzzz——”</p>

<p>Danny put out his lantern. In the darkness
he turned the corner and watched the spy
at work. The yellow light of the candle was
not sufficient to pierce the shadows and reveal
him to the enemy. What should he do now?
As before, he longed to attack the man. But
this course would, he knew, be worse than
useless. The spy was very much intent upon
his work. Inch by inch Danny crawled
nearer. What should he do?</p>

<p>Suddenly an inspiration came. The man
was facing the wall, his back to the passage.
His ears were filled with the noise of the buzzer,
his eyes fixed on a notebook he held in his hand.
His whole attention was engrossed. It might
be possible, with great care, to slip behind
him in the dim light and pass by! It would
be a desperate attempt, but it was <i>the only way</i>.</p>

<p>Danny measured the space with his eye.
His heart beat wildly. Dare he attempt it?
Of course, he would dare anything for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
England! And this was not a forlorn
hope; it was a chance of escape depending
upon steady nerve, self-control, and infinite
care.</p>

<p>He remembered how he had always been
the best Cub at “stalking” when the Cubmaster
stood blindfold, and the Cubs
had to creep near him. That practice had
not been wasted. Inch by inch he crept up.
“Buzz, buzz!” went the apparatus. Oh, if
only it would go on buzzing—if only the spy
would stick to his job for five minutes longer!
Nearer and nearer Danny crawled. Once
he lay flat and <i>froze</i>, as the spy changed his
position and actually glanced up the dark
passage! Then he resumed his slow progress.</p>

<p>At last he crouched a yard from the man.
The buzzer buzzed hard; the spy bent forward,
writing in his book. Like a mouse running
silently along the wainscot, Danny slid past
him, almost brushing the man’s legs. Without
pausing or turning, not daring to breathe,
he crawled on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>At last, hidden by the shadows, he paused,
and, kneeling up, slowly turned his head. The
man was still intent on his work. The task
was accomplished! Danny breathed again.
There was infinite gratitude in his pounding
heart.</p>

<p>Rising softly to a standing position, he
tiptoed on down the passage. He had been
forced, of course, to leave his lantern behind.
He dared not use his electric light in case another
spy lurked ahead. In the pitch darkness
he pressed on as quickly as he could. Every
now and then he paused to listen. There was
no sound of following steps. He felt pretty
confident that he would not meet a German at
the end of the passage, for they would not dare
try to get in or out by daylight, and by now
the sun must have risen. Before long the
Scouts on the day watch would be coming to relieve
those who had patrolled the roads the long
night through. No, the spies would have little
chance above ground—they must stay in their
horrible underground haunts, or up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
tower. They were like rats in a trap! Danny
nearly laughed aloud at the thought, for once
he was out of the passage, these rats would be
in his power!</p>

<p>Splash, splash! He had stepped without
knowing it into the water. He paused a
minute, nerving himself for what was to
follow. Then the thought that only this lay between
him and freedom gave him new courage.
Wading in, he was soon waist-deep. When the
water was up to his neck, and he had already
descended four steps, he took a big breath
and dived. Three, four, five strong strokes
and he was out in the dim, green light at the
bottom of the pool. A fish swam out of his
way. Weeds and lily buds swayed about
him. He raised his hands above his head,
kicked with his legs, and rose to the surface of
the pool. He was free, free, free!</p>

<p>The early-morning sun shone down in
golden glory through the trees. A thousand
birds were singing. Scrambling out of the
water, Danny stood on the bank and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
around him at the beautiful world he had
scarcely hoped to see again.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” he said from the bottom
of his heart. Then he set briskly out to
perform the great duty that lay before him.</p>

<small>IN THE HANDS OF THE SCOUTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few minutes Danny could do nothing
but stand on the edge of the pool, in the
glorious sunlight, beneath the great blue sky,
and realise that he was <i>free</i>. It was like
waking up from a ghastly nightmare.</p>

<p>After shaking himself like a dog and
squeezing some of the water out of his clothes,
he turned up the little path leading to the
road.</p>

<p>Where should he go? To whom should he
report? He had such a wonderful story
to tell, such a network of clues to unravel,
such important information to report—it
was difficult to know where to start. And
would they ever take him seriously? he
wondered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Feeling in his pocket, he drew forth a flat
cigarette-tin. It contained his precious notebook.
For, with the forethought of a true
Scout, he had realised that at any time a
swim in the pool might be necessary, and
that it was important to keep his book dry.
It contained his report, carefully written out,
with dates and diagrams, up till the night of
his capture. The events since then were not
entered, of course, but they were imprinted
forever on his brain. Can any one ever forget
moments when death seems very near, or
when an unseen hand seems to protect one
marvellously and set one free?</p>

<p>Glancing at his entries, Danny decided that
his little book would not be much use in
helping to explain the immediate dangers that
must be dealt with. It was useless to try and
tell the whole story from the beginning. To
get the Germans caught was all that mattered.
His book would be useful as evidence later,
so he replaced it in his pocket and set out
along the road in search of the Scouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>It was not long before he came on two of
them marching briskly along their piece of
road.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” they said. “What on earth are you
doing out at this time of the morning? And
you’re soaking wet, and in no end of a mess.
Your uniform’s all torn, and—what’s up with
your wrists? They’re all bleeding! My
word, you <i>will</i> get in a row!”</p>

<p>“Can’t help that,” said Danny. “There’s
something jolly important up. Who’s the
P. L. in charge? I’ve got to report it at
once.”</p>

<p>“Michael Byrne’s just come on with us—but
Dick is only just going off with the night
chaps. If you buck up you’ll catch him,”
said the Scouts.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Danny, and set off down
the road at the double. Old Mike was a
good chap and a friend of Danny’s, but somehow
he didn’t seem the best chap to whom
to report. The Senior P. L. was the very
person Danny wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Rounding the corner, he saw a party of
Scouts ahead, walking slowly towards the village.
It must be those who had been on duty
all night, just going back to bed. Danny
slowed down into a walk again to get his
breath, but before long he had caught them
up. Stepping up to Dick’s side, he saluted
smartly.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Danny!” said Dick, surprised. The
other fellows all opened their mouths to make
the same kind of remarks that the first two
Scouts had made, but Danny spoke at once
without waiting for them.</p>

<p>“Dick,” he said, “I’ve got something
jolly important to report to you at once. Can
I speak to you, alone? We mustn’t lose a
sec.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” said Dick Church, and Danny
noted with relief that he spoke perfectly
seriously.</p>

<p>Some of the Scouts began to laugh and make
jokes about “Danny the Detective,” but Dick
rounded on them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Shut up, you chaps!” he said. “Can’t
you see the kid’s as white as a sheet, and all
over blood, and his clothes torn and soaked?
He wouldn’t get in that state for fun. Go
on—don’t wait for me.” He turned to Danny,
and suddenly took his arm, for the boy was
swaying, his head was turning dizzily.</p>

<p>“Jim,” he called, after the retreating Scouts,
“have you got some tea left in your billy?”</p>

<p>Jim came back.</p>

<p>“Here you are, kid—have a drink!”
said Dick, giving him the cup. “Sit down!
You’ll be all right in a minute!”</p>

<p>The tea bucked Danny up no end. His
knees stopped knocking together.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said. “Don’t know why
I felt so funny; I’m all right now.”</p>

<p>“Then what is it you have to report?” said
Dick, sitting down on the bank.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Danny, “first I think you may
want those chaps when you hear.” He pointed
after the Scouts.</p>

<p>Dick blew his whistle. “I say,” he shouted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
as they turned round, “sit down and wait
for me. I shan’t be long.” The Scouts
obeyed.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Dick, “fire away!”</p>

<p>Danny took a big breath. “There is a
party of German spies,” he said, “quite near
here. One is tapping this very cable. Others
are watching and signalling from the Abbey
Tower. They have a store of guns and ammunition.”</p>

<p>“Are you kidding?” said Dick, searching
Danny’s face with keen eyes.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head. “I’m not,” he
said, “on my honour.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen these spies?” said Dick
quietly, watching the Cub intently.</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been their prisoner all night, and
have only just escaped.” He held out his
hands. “I hurt them,” he said, “getting free.”</p>

<p>Dick nodded. “Where are they hiding?”
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“In an underground passage, and in the
tower.”</p>

<p>“Are they there now?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where is the entrance to the underground
passage?”</p>

<p>“There are two. One is in the Abbey ruins,
and one at the bottom of the mill pond.”</p>

<p>“Where are they tapping the cable?”</p>

<p>“About three hundred yards down this
road. Wires run down the telegraph post.
The man has a buzzer below, in the passage.”</p>

<p>Dick took his whistle from his pocket and
blew three short blasts and a long one. Two
leaders and two seconds jumped up from the
seated group ahead, and came up at the
double. “Allen,” said Dick, “take your patrol
down to the mill, set three boys to watch the
pond, and you and the others search the mill
and outhouses. Don’t leave the pond unguarded
for an instant. It is being used
by spies.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” said Allen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“If you pass Michael,” said Dick, “tell
him I’ve sent you back on duty, for a special
guard.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Allen, and doubled off.</p>

<p>“Marchant, you and your chaps must come
with me,” said Dick. “We are on the scent
of something hot this time. Lead ahead,
Danny.”</p>

<p>The Kangaroos passed at the double, a grin
of content on every face. This really <i>was</i> war.
The Otters fell in behind Dick and their leader
with mystified expressions. Ten minutes later
the party had arrived at Danny’s house.</p>

<p>“You must come through my garden,”
he said.</p>

<p>The Scouts followed him. Across the cabbage
patch they crept, between the gooseberry
bushes, and through the little hole in the
hedge. White dew lay thick on the grass,
and a whole colony of rabbits darted up,
surprised, and scuttled away.</p>

<p>“Here,” said Danny, as the party halted
by the ruins of the Abbot’s House, “here is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
entrance to the secret passage. You have to
get through the window.”</p>

<p>“Get through!” commanded Dick.</p>

<p>Following their guide, the patrol got through.
It was pitch dark. Dick switched on his electric
torch. Down the steps they crept.</p>

<p>“This is the door to the passage,” said
Danny, as the Scouts reached the low archway.</p>

<p>“How many spies are in the passage?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p>“One,” said Danny.</p>

<p>“Two of you chaps—Bill and Knobby—stay
here on guard. Have you got staves?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“<i>And axes</i>,” added Knobby, with a ferocious
emphasis.</p>

<p>“If any one tries to open that door from
the inside, keep it shut—see?”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Bill.</p>

<p>With Danny leading the way, the party,
now minus two, crept out again into the
sunlight.</p>

<p>“This is the way they get from the passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
to the tower,” said Danny, as they walked
across the open space of grass and climbed
through the hole in the wall into the cloisters.
“I saw their wet footprints on the flagstones,
leading up to the door of the tower,” he
added.</p>

<p>“How many are in the tower?” said Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t know for certain,” replied Danny.
“But I have seen four belonging to the gang
myself. One is in the passage. There are
probably three or more up there.”</p>

<p>Dick tried the door. It was locked.</p>

<p>“Four of you stand on guard outside this
door,” he said. “Two get further out in the
ruin; one must keep his eyes on the top of the
tower, and the other just patrol around.
Danny, come with me.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later Dick was pushing his
motor-bike out of its shed. Before long the
boys were tearing down the road, Danny
sitting on the carrier, clinging to Dick’s belt.</p>

<p>“Stop me at the telegraph post, won’t
you?” he called over his shoulder.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Right,” panted Danny, through the wind.
“Whoa!” he shouted presently. “Here we
are!”</p>

<p>Dick stopped and jumped off, leaning his
bike against the bank.</p>

<p>“There—do you see?” whispered Danny,
brushing aside a mass of nettles and revealing
the old drain pipe. “There goes the wire. Do
you see?—it runs up the post. They’ve cut a
groove for it and tarred it over, so it scarcely
shows! The German chap is just down there.
Put your ear to the hole—you may hear the
buzzer.”</p>

<p>Dick lay down in the ditch, his ear glued to
the pipe.</p>

<p>“By Jove, so I can!” he whispered excitedly.
“It’s quite clear—yes—yes!...” He listened
intently for some minutes. Then he got up.
“I can’t make any sense of it—it’s in code.”
He ground his teeth. “And to think that
beast is taking it all down!” he whispered.
Then a sudden inspiration seized him.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon put a stop to his eavesdropping!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
he exclaimed. “It may give the show
away, that he’s found out, but if he tries to
escape, our chaps will nab him all right.”</p>

<p>Taking his axe from its case, Dick dealt a
blow to the post, severing both wires.</p>

<p>“Now I must connect them again, up there,”
he said, and proceeded to swarm quickly up
the post. Danny watched admiringly.</p>

<p>Clinging on with his legs, Dick worked
with deft fingers. He had not got his Telegraphist
Badge for nothing.</p>

<p>“That’s done,” he said, sliding down.
“Now for Captain Miles.”</p>

<p>As they flew past the mill, Danny waved his
hand to Allen and the Kangaroos on duty
there. Then he began to think anxiously of
the report he was to make to Captain Miles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>CAUGHT AT LAST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Outside</span> Danny’s garden gate, an important-looking
group of people were standing. In
fact, they looked so important and so interesting
that most of the inhabitants of the village
had turned out to stare at them. Two Sixes
of Cubs had been posted as a cordon to keep
the staring crowd from touching the three grey
motor cars or otherwise annoying the group.</p>

<p>This consisted of Captain Miles and a young
officer, a sergeant and ten hefty privates, a
police inspector and three constables, a private
detective, Dick and Danny.</p>

<p>“Here he comes!” said Dick. The Scout
who had been sent up to the Hall was returning,
accompanied by the pompous butler,
bearing the great iron key that unlocked the
gate of the Abbey ruins. It would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
rather ignominious for an officer of the British
army to have to crawl through cabbages
and gooseberry bushes and a small hole in a
privet hedge—or so thought the Scouts—though
Captain Miles was quite prepared to
do so.</p>

<p>“But it would be difficult bringing the
prisoners out that way,” said Danny. The
constables grinned at the small boy’s assurance.
And the private detective (the <i>real</i>
one) looked green with envy.</p>

<p>“Lead the way, young Cub,” said Captain
Miles, as the gate swung open with a screech
of rusty hinges.</p>

<p>For the second time that day, Danny walked
across the grassy space of the Abbot’s garden.
And his heart was light and his ambitious soul
satisfied, for behind him walked an officer,
and men with fixed bayonets. Two privates
relieved the Scouts who still crouched in the
darkness within the ruin of the Abbot’s
House. They blinked like owls as they climbed
out into the sunlight again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“We will deal with the tower first,” said
Captain Miles.</p>

<p>Danny led the way to the tower door.</p>

<p>To their disappointment, the officer ordered
Danny and the Scouts to retire to a safe distance.
But from there they watched, their
hearts beating with excitement.</p>

<p>Two of the privates, after several efforts,
succeeded in bursting open the little door.
Then, with his revolver in his hand and followed
by the sergeant and three privates,
Captain Miles entered. Several breathless
minutes passed. And then they reappeared,
but not alone. Sheepish, sullen, and securely
handcuffed, three Germans stepped out between
their burly guards.</p>

<p>“Come on!” called Captain Miles to the
Scouts, a grin of satisfaction on his cheery
face.</p>

<p>Danny and the Scouts obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve caught Fritz and his pals,
all right,” said Captain Miles, “thanks to
‘Danny the Detective.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>The three Germans stared at Danny with
an expression of such loathing that it made
cold shivers run down his back.</p>

<p>Two sentries were posted with fixed bayonets
each side of the tower door, for the fourth
spy was to be caught before the tower was
investigated.</p>

<p>The party moved over to the Abbot’s House.
Captain Miles, the sergeant, and four privates
climbed through the ruined window, and disappeared
into the darkness. The group outside
stood listening breathlessly. They heard
the iron door creak as it swung back on its
rusty hinges. Then silence.</p>

<p>But suddenly a yell rent the air, followed by
a great explosion. Then silence again. The
young officer, accompanied by the privates
and constables, climbed through the window
and dashed across the dark house into
the passage. Feverishly the Scouts waited
without. The minutes seemed to drag by
like hours. What had happened? Then a
sound fell on their ears. Heavy, shuffling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
steps were crossing the rough floor of the
house.</p>

<p>“Here, give us a hand,” said a voice within.
The Scouts were ready.</p>

<p>One by one the members of the first party
were passed through the window. They were
badly wounded. Several were unconscious.
Laying them on the grass, the Scouts turned
to Dick for instructions. Each received his
orders promptly and clearly. One sped off
for a doctor, another to telephone for an ambulance,
another to fetch such articles as could
be borrowed to render first aid to the wounded
men.</p>

<p>Quickly and skilfully tourniquets were applied
to arrest the flow of blood that already
dyed the grass red. Everyone was pale and
horrified.</p>

<p>“What happened?” was the whisper that
passed from one to the other.</p>

<p>“The—chap—threw a bomb—and—made
off,” said the only man fit to speak.</p>

<p>The young officer had returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Captain Miles has had a narrow shave,”
he said, “but he’s all right. He’s gone on with
some more men. Now, let’s see to these poor
chaps.”</p>

<p>But he found they were all being seen to very
well, and he learnt for the first time what the
Scout motto means. Through years of peace
the Scouts had been preparing themselves.
With keenness and energy they had been learning,
practising much that seemed to outsiders
of but little use. “Be Prepared,” was the
motto their Chief had given them. And
“Stick to it,” was the one they had added.
The war has proved who, after all, was in the
right.</p>

<p>The Kangaroos had been told to guard the
mill pond. They had not been told why it
was necessary to keep a sharp watch upon it,
beyond that it was being used by the enemy.
But, being Scouts, they had obeyed the order
and kept a vigilant lookout, though it seemed
quiet and peaceful enough.</p>

<p>The two whose turn it was to watch were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
lying well ambushed, their eyes upon the water,
when to their immense surprise a head suddenly
rose above the surface.</p>

<p>Its hair was plastered down with slime and
duck-weed. Its eyes looked about in a terrified
manner. Seeing no one, the owner of
the head swam to the side of the pond, and
quickly, cautiously, clambered on to the bank.</p>

<p>Then the two Scouts dashed forward. In a
minute they had him down, his arms pinned
to his sides.</p>

<p>A long “Coo-ee!” brought up the other
Kangaroos at the double, and “Fritz” found
himself a helpless prisoner.</p>

<p>Leaving the rest to keep watch on the pond,
the Leader of the Kangaroos marched off his
prisoner between two hefty guards.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>“WELL DONE, DANNY!”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, Captain Miles and his party
searched the passage in vain. The spy had
vanished. Realising what might have happened,
the officer sent back a party to go as
quickly as possible to the mill, whilst he continued
to search the vault. And so the party
bound for the mill met the prisoner and his
guards on the road, and returning, reported
this to Captain Miles.</p>

<p>Packing the four Germans and their guards
into a motor lorry, and putting the young
officer in charge, he sent them to the town
and turned his attention to the necessary investigations.</p>

<p>Pausing at the door of the tower.</p>

<p>“Look here, young Wolf Cub,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
“you’ve done some very smart work in discovering
all this, and proved yourself <i>some</i>
detective. You may come with me and investigate
the tower. That valuable notebook
of yours will then contain the end of the
story. It will be a treasure worth keeping.”</p>

<p>And so Danny, in the seventh heaven of
happiness, accompanied the officer up the
winding stairs.</p>

<p>At the top of the tower they discovered a
wireless apparatus, a cage of carrier pigeons,
a powerful flashlight, and a large store of provisions.</p>

<p>“We knew there was something bad on,”
said Captain Miles, “but not like this! You’ve
done your country a good turn, indeed, in
discovering it! Well done, Danny!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That night the Troop and the Pack met at
Troop Headquarters. Much ginger beer
flowed. Then the Scoutmaster blew his
whistle and, standing, on a soap box, addressed
the assembled company. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
long speech, but everyone listened, spellbound,
for he told them the whole story of Danny’s
adventures, since the first day, after the paper-chase.</p>

<p>When he had done, the Troop and Pack
broke into cheers.</p>

<p>“Order, order!” shouted the Leaders, as
the Cubmaster mounted the soap box.</p>

<p>“Your grasping Scoutmaster has tried to
steal Danny and get him for his Troop,” he
said. “But Danny has chosen to stay with
us. I must announce that he has been
elected Pack Leader, by the unanimous vote
of the Pack—and we are jolly proud of him.”</p>

<p>“Speech, speech!” called everyone, and
someone put Danny on the soap box.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d all chuck it,” he said. “I
don’t deserve any praise. It was simply ripping
fun—just what I had always longed for.
I’ve had great luck, that’s all.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Your Pack Leader will need a cap several
sizes larger soon,” said the Scoutmaster to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Cubmaster, as he opened the morning paper
the next day.</p>

<p>Before long there was a letter of thanks from
the Government, a medal, and a cheque for
£100.</p>

<p>But there was something Danny valued
more than all the rest. It was just a short
letter of congratulations. But he took it
away and read it all by himself in the garden,
and did not show it to anybody else for quite
a long time.</p>

<p>It was from the Chief Scout.</p>

<p>It tells how “Sam Morgan’s Boy,”
well known to readers of Mr. Hendryx’s
“Connie Morgan in Alaska,” daringly
rescued a man who was rushing to destruction
on an ice floe and how, in recognition
of his quick-wittedness and
nerve, he was made a Special Constable
in the Northwest Mounted Police, with
the exceptional adventures that fell to
his lot in that perilous service. It is a
story of the northern wilderness, clean
and bracing as the vigorous, untainted
winds that sweep over that region;
the story of a boy who wins out
against the craft of Indians and the guile
of the bad white man of the North; the
story of a boy who succeeds where men
fail.</p>
